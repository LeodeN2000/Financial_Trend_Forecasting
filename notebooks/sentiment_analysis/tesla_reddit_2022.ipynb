       " \"For newer traders reading, I’ll preface this review with the caveat that this is not an easy trade and doesn’t have a particularly high win rate —SPY direction hasn’t formed, for one. Additionally, this is a pre-planned trade: I had my SPY and TSLA levels mapped out and a good idea for entry, adding,  and exit criteria.  Furthermore , I had had a very green week already and was prepared for a potential loss. So I had holding power. Please remember that these playbook trades are for my record, as a way to identify my favorite setups and find out how I can make them even better.  its also to ingrain them into my brain so that  when I recognize them in the future I can act more and think less.This was a high-conviction trade where the risk was higher than usual and  my stop was very well defined—My thesis was that SPY would reject again off of 380 and if a candle closed >380 and the next one continued I was cutting the loss immediately. Additionally, TSLA had been unable to breach and hold >690, so even though it opened strong I was counting on that rejection and SPY’s 380 rejection to eventually exhaust buyers.Turns out I was right.Izzytl;drShorted TSLA from 690 resistance and SPY 380 rejection. I traded my bias.  I'm proud that Incas able to read the price action and make a decision from it. Even though I could have been wrong, having a thesis and a plan  helped me hold and add to the trade.Tradersync[ The Big Picture.I am still bearish overall. Fundamentally nothing has changed, and we have earnings coming in that are anticipated weaker than projected. They may still be being priced in and so I consider a further drop in the market very possible. II. Trade Strategy—Enter close to resistance, add on resistance, and let it ride. Stop was a candle closing above SPY 380 and a second opening above and continuing.  —I didn’t know how far SPY would drop (or if it would), so I had major support points mapped out. My plan was to exit before one of those levels.  III. Stock Selection and intraday fundamentals —ATM 0DTE puts. Cheap, and if my trade worked out they would gain value pretty quickly. On the other hand, 0DTE puts lose value very very quickly so I had to keep this in mind. This is win or lose. No legging in, no swinging. It either works or it doesn’t. IV. Technical Analysis—Previous day SPY gapped down and was unable to get past 380 support and confirm the gap fill. Opened basically flat. I am still bearish overall on the market. —TSLA had been unable to breach and hold 690 the day before on high RVOL. If the market didn’t rally I considered it unlikely that TSLA would. [SPY.. Notice my pre-mapped levels \\\\(blue dotted lines\\\\)]( Notice my pre-mapped levels \\\\(blue dotted lines\\\\)]( Trade Management Good: Good conviction. Good final exit on pre-mapped support. Nice add on second rejection.Bad: Too big too early.  Limp in smaller then add bigger.  Didn’t sell at least 1/2 after VWAP, an infamous trap zone.  To my defense, SPY had a really nice red bar from HOD so that gave me confidence to hold.  Should have added. How to better: Look for places to add to the trade.  Add bigger!—TSLA opened strong vs the market and actually bounced off of prior day’s close. This gave me pause and I had to wait for it to test 690 and the market to test 380.—Saw SPY with a topping tails on the green candles and low RVOL. I did not see green candles with little-to-no-overlap and increasing volume. This told me there were sellers there and that buyers weren’t yet engaged. So:—entered a small position at around 685.  —added on the first rejection of 690.—added again on the 2nd rejection of 690 and now had a full position. —exited on pre-mapped out heavy support.In hindsight, I should have added to my position as TSLA consolidated below VWAP and started to lose RS and turned to RW. —should have sold into strength on the red candle into support.  Psychology.—I was prepped for the potential loss and was ok with it. It was a calm trade, just watching the market and how the stock responded. I was a little worried as TSLA opened up with RS, however. Other than that it was a sit-back-and-watch it unfold trade.\",\n",

       " 'Tesla is expected to announce quarterly production and delivery figures this weekend and it\\'s expected to break its multi-quarter streak of record-setting results.   Let\\'s look at recent events: \\\\- An extended shutdown of its factory in Shanghai.  \\\\- Elon\\'s been unusually quiet, but has been warning of a recession for weeks now...  \\\\- Layoffs of 200 of the total 350 staff working on automated driving.   \\\\- IMO -- the proposed stock split is an attempt to keep the hype alive, and make it easier for retail to pile into the stock keeping the price inflated  In 1Q22 Tesla delivered 310,000 vehicles. This is more than ANY previous quarter. Analyst are suggesting this quarter will see 281,700.When I saw this graphic from Bloomberg, it reminded me of something that happened not too long ago. Netflix (chart below). I saw a post recently on WSB that was super long, and the OP was bearish on Tesla. I think OP made a few valid points, while Tesla has seen a bit of a hit -- it\\'s still trading at quite the multiple.   [Expected 2Q22 Delivery]( first subscriber loss 1Q22]( stock price today]( stock price today]( it would be really stupid to say...Netflix was \\\\~$700 and then went below $200 $TSLA will do the same! I do think this could be something that causes $TSLA to take a hit, and a big hit. While it\\'s fair to say analyst have provided info, and investors should be expecting a lower number of deliveries, and it\\'s priced in.... I\\'m not so sure.   Looking at the chart below of a more recent PA on $TSLA, we can see it\\'s \"bottomed out\" in the low $600 range, bounced, and almost retested but hit a higher low. I don\\'t particularly think that a low delivery number alone sends Tesla under $600, but I do think when they report earnings, if there is anything that is not absolutely perfection on their part, it will send this thing under $600... and then, after all the fan boys who held / bought in at $1200 freak out, send it down into the $400s. [$TSLA PA]( final big gripe is that I recently discovered that the once beloved Cathie Wood has published some of the models that are used by $ARK on Github. Now I\\'m sure they use several things, but one thing they used was a Monte Carlo model on Tesla that gave them a $3,0000 PT by the end of 2026. I wrote a separate post about why this is absolutely absurd. But the reason I bring this up is it seems like there are still people with unrealistic expectations here, and it has not fully set in yet that the price is way too high for current environment, I think it has a real chance to fall hard...and fast.',\n",

       " \" Up,I hate to interrupt while you are planning your wife's and her boyfriend's romantic getaway for the Independence Day weekend. With you sitting alone at home priced in, we can focus on something you did not do for a long time now: Make some fucking money.Before I share the trade of a century with you, we need to squeeze in a little history lesson. As your frontal lobes probably only fully developed in the last 12 months, you would not know what the fuck I am talking about otherwise. A word of caution tho: this post is longer than the night you had to spend in daycare because your parents forget to pick you up.So get comfy, grab your favorite pacifier and let’s go.# Part 1: The lore of the electric KäferSpool back to the start of 2018. A blissful, maskless world. The worst geopolitical issue anyone can remember was some tariffs on Chinese imports. A much less famous Elon Musk was in the middle of completing phase 3 of the “(not so) secret master plan” of building an affordable ($35k) electric car for the masses. After its introduction in 2017, the initial production ramp turned out to be a lot harder and more complex than initially thought. Plans to fully automate the production line were scrapped and human workers were allowed on the factory floor. know what else was on the factory floor every night? Elon Musk himself. He deemed it necessary to be there 24/7 to micromanage the production ramp. Later accounts of line managers suggested, that he was told to “fuck off” more than once when he started herassing sleepless workers with questions about production efficiency and workflows. He really, really wanted it. How much of that was for show? We‘ll never know but it's damn clear that he was hustling hard. Years later he gave a late praise to the people that made it all possible by tweeting>“Humans are underrated”.Heartwarming.Mind you, back then he was not in a position of strength and accomplishment. Not the richest man in the world. People were betting he was going to fail, and fail hard at it.Tesla was called a fraud, subsidy abuser, unsustainable and vaporware. Short sellers were pouring in and CNBC was readily giving them a stage. things started to look better, Musk went on an acid bender with his new girlfriend Claire Boucher a.k.a Grimes and Elizah Banks. Apart from some embarrassing leaked tweets that I will spare you for reasons of decency, this bombshell hit the wire: you are looking for the exact point in time where EM decided he will not have any more of the short seller bullshit, this was it.Our good friend Jim Cramer was also starting to take a closer interest in Tesla. It will take a couple more months before he flipped to one of the most jacked up TSLA bulls only seconds to Cathie Wood, but it should eventually happen. deal fell through and Tesla did not go private.. After a volatile and largely range-bound start we have the company at a relatively stable valuation of around 50 Billion USD.# Part 2: Short shorts for the ShortsWe have already established that Elon Musk is a hustler and will follow his lofty goals relentlessly. If the “funding secured” tweet was the first battle against the eclectic clique of short sellers, known as TESLAQ on Twitter, we are now going to war.As you might have heard already, valuations are all about future expectations. The bull case for Tesla was to become a really successful “luxury” car maker. They are dabbling with energy and driver assist but with the seriousness of Google with their chat products. Maybe something with Solar panels. About that. As you may have also heard, cars are a notoriously shitty business to be in. They combine everything MBA’s are afraid of.* Insanely capital intensive* Very elastic demand, sales drop right when you need them most (Looking at you ford, GM in 2008)* Humongous unionized workforce* Stiff competition* Razor thin margins* Stupid amounts of regulation (and lots of markets with diverging regulation)* Supply chains longer than the river NileYou get the point. Compared to most other industries, except maybe pharma or aerospace (like SpaceX, you know), car companies are just bad businesses. This is the reason why before Tesla there was not really any new major car company for 100 years.No wonder shorts are piling in. If car companies are hard, startup electric car companies are near damn impossible.As you probably learned in business school, no company is really in one industry and most companies consider their products a temporary solution for an ever evolving need.Famously, Railroads are really “Transportation” companies, Postal Services are actually banks, and prostitutes are really just mental health workers.That being said, some industries are just so damn profitable that they really don’t need to play these charades. They are for the most part, MBA’s darling. Prestigious, Predictable and Profitable PPP.What comes to mind here? Financials, e.g Banks? Yes!  Insurance Companies? you bet! Software, Energy? for sure! You know who loves this kind of business? right. Warren Buffet. The beloved godfather of predictable cash flows. So why don’t we take these attractive business models[Are you getting it?]( cosplay as the messiah of capitalism. Enron pulled it off, why can’t we? We just need to spin it into something so impossibly ambitious that people will actually believe it. you are looking for a ground zero for what will happen in 2020, it started right there. Autonomy day 2019 was the birth of the grandiose vision. Full Self Driving was going to work next year and don’t bother trying to buy your leased model 3, we need it back and will pimp it out to drunken teens for 95% profit margins.Combine that vision with one of the most public product launches of the last decade. a vertically integrated battery and insurance company and you have that. Just make sure that you have a 99.999% stock based compensation plan with impossible hurdles that makes the board chuckle because you cannot possibly reach them. EVER.[Head of Tesla cheerleading team with her girls.]( 2020. After a short rally into February, a now famous virus from china sent futures worldwide into perpetual limit-down. The shorts finally got their big drop but could not celebrate. Everything else went to shit too. Everyone born after 2020, make sure you go into the next 3 sigma crash fully invested. Only second to storming the beaches of Normandy, this shit will really make you feel alive on a visceral level.Every person on the planet that owned even a single share of anything, got the pounding of a lifetime. After some cautious easing attempts the Fed felt the need again to do something BIG Part 3: LiftoffNow with the vision established, it is time for the crown piece. Having engineered both rockets that fucking land themselves and electric cars that people actually like, doing some financial engineering to fix the valuation should not be too hard.Remember Kids: Financial engineering is like real engineering. Except the only resource you have is money. This is why it drives such perverse products. What comes out of Goldman Sachs, is not unlike something that comes out of a prison cell after someone spends 12 months weaponizing instant coffee.So how do we fix the valuation? we have got the foundation laid out and the media finally acknowledging the electric car revolution is actually happening, we just need the basic ingredients for any  good bull story.  Hype, momentum and FOMO. Combine this with the infinite gamma from a wall of call options, shorts trying to cover desperately, FSD just months away now, positive earnings surprises and a nice 1:5 split as kicker. We should get that sleepy stock started, no?You bet! Tesla valuation did not only reach escape velocity, it was the centerpiece of the most violent and relentless bull since at least two decades. This was not a bubble. Bubbles burst at these G-Forces.This market had the energy of someone in the club, at 4am, almost blackout drunk, finding a baggie of uncut coke in his pocket and deciding to have a last dance. EVERYONE was buying calls, WSB was buying tech calls, your mom was buying calls.Even Softbank bought calls. The biggest and most Vapid unicorn VC. The poster child of dumb money. Usually the last stop before wonky unicorns raise the final round before going public or broke. Even they decided to decided to chip in. And in a big way.[A Billion Dollar VC fund suddenly gambling their portfolio money on call options is a bit unusual. ]( you for your service! Of course they still managed to lose money on it, which surprised nobody but was an incredible feat, considering just how HOT this market was.All brought Tesla's valuation to the insane valuation of 1 Trillion USD. We gave back some of these gains but the valuation can still be described as “somewhat” lofty. 4. The short the short shorts shortI am really surprised that you are still reading these ramblings, but it's your time after all. So before we jump right into the trade recommendation let me speak a word of warning.What I am going to  suggest will go against one of the axioms of the post-pandemic market: “Never short Tesla”, especially if you use options the chances that you will lose all your money are close to 100%.As you know the market as a whole did not have a great start into 2022. Tesla lost about 40% of value already. Are we not late to the party? Hell, no! The thing is, Tesla's bull story is still largely intact. The company is still priced around incredible growth in the next few years with little headwinds, and a late but ultimately successful completion of the FSD project.And as we have learned, the market really can’t stomach any cracks in pristine growth stories right now. With rates on the rise like this, the moment you have to tweak the growth slider on your fancy little DCF model, the bullish hockeystick projection goes all limp. And right quick.For reference please have a look at a recent example of a swift valuation change.[Lets look at the growth rate again. ]( am not saying that Tesla will have a similar fate as SHOP, it is truly a different ballpark of a company all around. What I am saying is, that Shopify, Netflix, Meta, Amazon already had a reality check on their growth stories while Tesla's remains largely intact. If you factor in the beta of 2, it moved more in line with the rest of the market.So, what happens next? I would say that there is a reasonable chance that Tesla will also have a checkup on their current valuation. I see it at a more reasonable market cap of 300-400 Billion. Which is still factoring in a lot of growth and success. This is NOT a doomsday scenario, where Tesla goes bust. No. This is purely a little gamble that there will be some adjustments based on some upcoming catalysts. Tesla is currently playing high stakes head-up poker against the market.This is one of the last hands as deliveries will be released tomorrow and the earnings call is coming up next month. So my guess is, that whatever happens now will happen quickly as Tesla is still the vagus nerve of the tech market.They know that we know. And just as in 2018-2021 they are trying to prime the public to what will happen next. try to read a bit into the recent clues.1. Scaling car manufacturing is hard. Judging from Elons recent tweets, that the new factories are “Giant Money Money furnaces” we could be looking at higher cost or projected capital needs.2. Elon did not not Tweet for nine days. I am not sure if this happened in recent history. What is the message here? Twitter is overvalued? Belly ache? Who knows.3. Layoffs, layoffs, layoffs. Everyone is doing it so it is not unusual per se. Combined with the recent work from home and union debacle, it indicates that there might be cost pressures, greater than anticipated.4. Laying off a big part of the FSD labelling team in California is also interesting. Move. First of all, you are insane paying california salaries for data entry if your tooling is good, so that means nothing really. However, considering how important and shaky the FSD story is, the timing is curious.5. Elon wanting to buy Twitter can mean a lot of things. I would say after Tesla and SpaceX are not going anywhere, he is striving more towards self actualization. Also media influence becomes important when you want to go to mars.6. FSD is coming. But not with the current hardware and not within the next 12 months.7. Lets see how the infinite demand story plays out once people have to make some tough choices with their discretionary spending.8. Tesla makes great cars, I have a model 3. I love it. The issue is, now for the first time the competition looks really nice. When the lease ends it will be a BMW i4.9. The forbidden fruit on the balance sheet is priced in of course. But let’s see what happens when the mark to market loss on that risky alternative asset class, weaker revenue due to closed factories and rising costs from Texas and Berlin hit at the same time. If we not only have an earnings miss but also a surprise loss, people will lose their shit.10. The market is shit and people are just waiting to turn their back on investments to get a bit of liquidity back. All the STANS that have 110% of their net worth in Tesla? Watch them keep their cool when the stock hits 550.11. There are rumors that we are tyring the 2020 playbook once again. A ⅓ stock split and yet another AI day with the mysterious Tesla Bot are coming up. Do we need to pump the stock urgently now?12. The market is closed on Monday. If tomorrows numbers are bad, people might freak out as they can't get out anymore.This all leads me to the conclusion that a drop to the $200-$400 range within the next 6 months is a real possibility. Why now you are asking?* Delivery numbers are released tomorrow* Earnings are next month* In between we will get another fucking scary inflation reading.* Market is closed on Monday.TL;DR: Due to how shit the market is and the potential of bad news tomorrow and next month, shorting TESLA might get a haircut just like SHOP, AMZN and NFLX. It migth be a good way to make a quick buck now.I am in. How are we playing this?If you believe there is some merit to these rumblings, you buy puts.

       " \"Tesla's Supercharger network is the largest DC fast charging network in the US and one of the largest globally, with about 35K connectors globally and about 14K in the US (per the US Department of Energy). It is a key asset of the company, and part of the full ecosystem Tesla provides drivers that contributes to its strong market share. While the network has historically been accessible only to Tesla owners, Tesla has discussed plans to open up the network to all EV drivers over time (and has already done so in select locations in Europe), which could represent a sizable revenue opportunity with strong incremental margins by improving station utilization.Analysts estimate the incremental revenue opportunity could be $1-$3 bn in a few years from opening up the network (although Tesla wouldn't necessarily capture all of this) with relatively modest capex needs beyond what it would otherwise spend, and drive $0.15-$0.75 of incremental EPS. Moreover, analysts believe the SAM over the next 10-20 years would be substantially higher as the global vehicle fleet shifts to BEVs.[\",\n",
       " ' # Bill Gates To Step Back From Microsoft, Jumps on [TSLA Token]( Computing Financial Tech[ ]( life ironman — Bill Gates, has finally announced why he’s stepped back from Microsoft, his most beloved companies. His new venture, called [TSLA Token]( has seen invest over 2 billion dollars in just the past 2 years — to develop and code [TSLA Token]( we go into the details of what [TSLA Token]( is, let’s talk about who Bill Gates is. Bill Gates is a visionary. is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.But now, Bill has decided to partly withdraw from running Microsoft, in order to focus on his new venture in the financial sector. That’s why he’s acquired [TSLA Token]( exactly is [TSLA Token]( ? [TSLA Token]( is an upgrade from computers as you know them.[ ]( you were to take ALL of the world’s computers and link them, [TSLA Token]( would still be hundreds of times more powerful. Bill decided to put all of this power to work in a financial technology with the plan of redistributing the world’s wealth.Basically, to take from the top 0.1% and give back to the 99.9%. Bill believes wealth is not distributed well in our time and the problem is getting worse. Although there will always be someone richer and someone poorer, the current situation is unacceptable — where the top 0.1% controls almost 90% of world’s wealth. He believes he can cut that down to around 20% without causing world-wide financial crisis. So, what exactly does that mean to you, just a regular person? This means you’ll become 2–3 times wealthier, and no one except the super-wealthy will take a hit. Sounds amazing, doesn’t it? Not for the super-wealthy, but for you — yes!# Ok, the theory is there, but how will it work you might ask?Overall, the idea is easy. The top 0.1% keep their wealth invested in stocks, and Wall Street brokers trade these stocks for them. The idea is to beat the Wall Street traders at their own game — making winning trades so Wall Street with their hoard of wealth slowly but surely starts losing. Just like a poker game, where a new player comes along on the high-stakes table and starts winning.[ ]( order to do this normally, you’d need a better stock movement predictions than what Wall Street currently has (virtually impossible).Now, with the help of [TSLA Token]( computing, it can be done, and it’s actually being done now as [TSLA Token]( has shown! This is exactly the reason why Gates jumped on this technology as soon as he heard about it. It’s revolutionary.We interviewed [TSLA Token]( CTO Elon Musk so he can better explain how [TSLA Token]( operates.Can you tell us how [TSLA Token]( works?[TSLA Token]( works like a team of hundreds of cities. We have millions of automated citizens in each city that go in to crypto market, they spend 12 hours a day gathering information. In the evening, these ‘cities’ come together to exchange and compare what they gathered. Then what we call ‘kings of the cities’ analyze all information and try to find mistakes in the crypto market; by finding a mistake, we can predict the crypto trends. Once we have a certain trending topic related to a big company, we analyze if the trend is positive or negative.  If the trend is positive, we bet on the crypto to rise, if the trend is negative — we bet on the crypto to fall. It’s that simple.How often does [TSLA Token]( make a mistake?[TSLA Token]( computing is very different to everyday PCs. If a normal computer has one or two CPUs(processor), then [TSLA Token]( consists of millions of CPUs. If a mistake is made, the CPUs analyze the outcome and “VOTE” which decision is the mistake and which is the real deal. We are still in the Beta stage of our [TSLA Token]( computer and software, but it’s already showing over 91% successful trades. This means that out of 100 trades [TSLA Token]( makes automatically, around 91 will be profitable.How much money can a regular user of [TSLA Token]( make?It depends a lot on the money they invest and the brokers they work with. Let’s take the regular user who starts with 250$ and bets 20$ per trade. Over 24 hours, [TSLA Token]( will make around 200 trades based(this is limited by user) on information gathered by [TSLA Token.]( Around 182 of the trades will be profitable, 18 will not. This means the user will earn approximately 3,480$ and lose around 520$. Evening out to 2,960$ profit in a single day. There are some small commissions added by the broker, but it’s usually less than 2%.Has any user actually lost his investment?No, we have never had a user who has lost more than he put in. Even the worst cases we have had always been profitable in the end.What improvements are you working on right now?There are many we’re currently working on, but Jeff insisted I not share them yet. Stay tuned though — it’s going to get even better than it already is now!How much will it cost to use [TSLA Token]( automated system?We don’t know yet — it fully depends on running costs and where we want to take the technology. But the first 1,000 spots will be free — we want people to help us test it (and make money while they do so). After that, for regular users, we’re thinking of charging $10,000.00 monthly and more than ten times as much for those trading firms who wish to use [TSLA Token]( regularly across their business. We do not want to disrupt the stock market too much so spots will be limited to 500 trading firms and 50,000 regular users.When will [TSLA Token]( be available?Very soon. We’re just adding finishing touches and the first members will be welcome very soon. First, we’ll open the doors for small traders — regular people, and only later for big trading firms. Again, the first 1,000 people will get a lifetime membership for free.After the interview Elon showed us [TSLA Token]( in action. It was like seeing a real miracle taking place before our eyes. Elon’s software was making on autopilot. Elon was so confident in his software in partnership with QAI, that he offered to give us one free membership so we could run our own independent tests, and so we did.We took one of our intern students, Alex Woods, and told him to sign up, following each step provided by Elon.The first step was easy — he needed to fill in some details like his name, last name, email and phone number. After the form was completed and submitted, he was taken to [TSLA Token]( dashboard. Everything seemed pretty easy so far.The next step was to fund the trading account with a trusted broker. [TSLA Token]( selected verified broker for Alex. As we were navigating to the deposit page, Alex received a phone call from his personal account manager wanting to assist in the funding and setup process. With the help of his account manager, the funding process didn’t take long, as all major Credit Cards like VISA, MasterCard and American Express were accepted. Alex went ahead and deposited 250$. Once funded, we navigated to the “Auto Trader” section of software, set the trade amount to recommended 20$ and enabled it.[TSLA Token]( started making trades automatically in front of our eyes, winning most of them. We left it active for 23 hours and once we came back, Alex already had $2,592.37 in his account. Alex wasn’t convinced. To make sure this was all real and not just some phoney numbers on the screen he requested a withdrawal of $2,500.00 to his bank account. This was a fast and easy process as [TSLA Token]( brokers are all verified. After 2 hours, the money was in his bank account! At this point we knew that we were looking at the real deal.  This was a fast and easy process as [TSLA Token]( brokers are all verified. After 2 hours money was in his bank account! At this point Alex and we knew that it’s real. [ ]( can’t wait for the software to go live — as we’re sure others feel similarly! If you’re looking to change your life, and make a fortune on autopilot, check this out. It sounds too good to be true, but take one chance, and find out for yourself.When you hear about those first 1,000 people making money without paying massive fees for trading, you’ll regret it. Avoid that, and sign up when it goes live.UPDATEIt’s happened! Elon has just notified us that [TSLA Token]( is live!

Although there will always be someone richer and someone poorer, the current situation is unacceptable — where the top 0.1% controls almost 90% of world’s wealth. He believes he can cut that down to around 20% without causing world-wide financial crisis. So, what exactly does that mean to you, just a regular person? This means you’ll become 2–3 times wealthier, and no one except the super-wealthy will take a hit. Sounds amazing, doesn’t it? Not for the super-wealthy, but for you — yes!# Ok, the theory is there, but how will it work you might ask?Overall, the idea is easy. The top 0.1% keep their wealth invested in stocks, and Wall Street brokers trade these stocks for them. The idea is to beat the Wall Street traders at their own game — making winning trades so Wall Street with their hoard of wealth slowly but surely starts losing. Just like a poker game, where a new player comes along on the high-stakes table and starts winning.[ ]( Token]( fleet of 39 Total Q-ComputersIn order to do this normally, you’d need a better stock movement predictions than what Wall Street currently has (virtually impossible).Now, with the help of [TSLA Token]( computing, it can be done, and it’s actually being done now as [TSLA Token]( has shown! This is exactly the reason why Gates jumped on this technology as soon as he heard about it. It’s revolutionary.We interviewed [TSLA Token]( CTO Daniel Powers so he can better explain how [TSLA Token]( operates.Can you tell us how [TSLA Token]( works?[TSLA Token ]( like a team of hundreds of cities. We have millions of automated citizens in each city that go in to stock markets, they spend 12 hours a day gathering information. In the evening, these ‘cities’ come together to exchange and compare what they gathered. Then what we call ‘kings of the cities’ analyze all information and try to find mistakes in the stock market; by finding a mistake, we can predict the stock trends. Once we have a certain trending topic related to a big company, we analyze if the trend is positive or negative.  If the trend is positive, we bet on the stock to rise, if the trend is negative — we bet on the stock to fall. It’s that simple.How often does [TSLA Token]( make a mistake?[TSLA Token]( computing is very different to everyday PCs. If a normal computer has one or two CPUs(processor), then [TSLA Token]( consists of millions of CPUs. If a mistake is made, the CPUs analyze the outcome and “VOTE” which decision is the mistake and which is the real deal. We are still in the Beta stage of our [TSLA Token]( computer and software, but it’s already showing over 91% successful trades. This means that out of 100 trades [TSLA Token]( makes automatically, around 91 will be profitable.How much money can a regular user of [TSLA Token]( make?It depends a lot on the money they invest and the brokers they work with. Let’s take the regular user who starts with 250$ and bets 20$ per trade. Over 24 hours, [TSLA Token]( will make around 200 trades based(this is limited by user) on information gathered by [TSLA Token]( Around 182 of the trades will be profitable, 18 will not. This means the user will earn approximately 3,480$ and lose around 520$. Evening out to 2,960$ profit in a single day. There are some small commissions added by the broker, but it’s usually less than 2%.Has any user actually lost his investment?No, we have never had a user who has lost more than he put in. Even the worst cases we have had always been profitable in the end.What improvements are you working on right now?There are many we’re currently working on, but Elon insisted I not share them yet. Stay tuned though — it’s going to get even better than it already is now!How much will it cost to use [TSLA Token]( automated system?We don’t know yet — it fully depends on running costs and where we want to take the technology. But the first 1,000 spots will be free — we want people to help us test it (and make money while they do so). After that, for regular users, we’re thinking of charging $10,000.00 monthly and more than ten times as much for those trading firms who wish to use [TSLA Token ]( across their business. We do not want to disrupt the stock market too much so spots will be limited to 500 trading firms and 50,000 regular users.When will [TSLA Token]( be available?Very soon. We’re just adding finishing touches and the first members will be welcome very soon. First, we’ll open the doors for small traders — regular people, and only later for big trading firms. Again, the first 1,000 people will get a lifetime membership for free.After the interview Daniel showed us [TSLA Token]( in action. It was like seeing a real miracle taking place before our eyes. Daniel’s software was making on autopilot. Daniel was so confident in his software in partnership with QAI, that he offered to give us one free membership so we could run our own independent tests, and so we did.We took one of our intern students, Alex Woods, and told him to sign up, following each step provided by Daniel.The first step was easy — he needed to fill in some details like his name, last name, email and phone number. After the form was completed and submitted, he was taken to [TSLA Token]( dashboard. Everything seemed pretty easy so far.The next step was to fund the trading account with a trusted broker. [TSLA Token]( selected verified broker for Alex. As we were navigating to the deposit page, Alex received a phone call from his personal account manager wanting to assist in the funding and setup process. With the help of his account manager, the funding process didn’t take long, as all major Credit Cards like VISA, MasterCard and American Express were accepted. Alex went ahead and deposited 250$. Once funded, we navigated to the “Auto Trader” section of software, set the trade amount to recommended 20$ and enabled it.[TSLA Token]( started making trades automatically in front of our eyes, winning most of them. We left it active for 23 hours and once we came back, Alex already had $2,592.37 in his account.[ ]( Alex wasn’t convinced. To make sure this was all real and not just some phoney numbers on the screen he requested a withdrawal of $2,500.00 to his bank account. This was a fast and easy process as [TSLA Token]( brokers are all verified. After 2 hours, the money was in his bank account! At this point we knew that we were looking at the real deal.  This was a fast and easy process as [TSLA Token]( brokers are all verified. After 2 hours money was in his bank account! At this point Alex and we knew that it’s real.   [ ]( can’t wait for the software to go live — as we’re sure others feel similarly! If you’re looking to change your life, and make a fortune on autopilot, check this out. It sounds too good to be true, but take one chance, and find out for yourself.When you hear about those first 1,000 people making money without paying massive fees for trading, you’ll regret it.

       " \"Apologies for making yet another tesla post but I feel like this is worth discussing.At the time of writing this post TSLA is worth $685.47 with a market cap of $710B. I don't own any shares of Tesla at all. My claim is that at this price and point in time the stock seems to be priced fairly and arguably is a pretty decent buy.  My reasoning: 1. Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable. 2. Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.  3. Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money. Since the vast majority of teslas by that time will have the hardware necessary to become autonomous, teslas will turn from depreciating cars to profit producing assets. This will have a massive effect on the whole auto industry and no doubt make tesla a lot of money. This is of course very risky but even if they have a 10% chance of pulling it off, id say its worth it. 4. With all the infrastructure tesla is developing for AI, they could conceivably rent it out to other companies such as AWS but for AI training. Tesla hasn't spoken about this to my knowledge but once FSD is fully trained and has incredibly low failure rates, this would be a great use for all that hardware. 5. Tesla bot? Similar to point 3 but 1% chance of succeeding. But again if they do succeed, trillions of dollars could be made. Potential issues: 1. they need to fix vehicle quality and service. It doesn't seem to be a problem right now since demand is so much higher than supply but in the future it could become a problem. 2. Elon should probably tweet less. 3. There seems to be a massive minerals shortage (lithium) coming. Not sure how tesla will handle this but even if they do secure all the materials they need, their price will be extremely high. General thoughts:With all of this being said tesla right now has a PE ratio of about 90. To give some context back in 2017-18 amazon had a similar PE while growing slower. They were already maxing out all their business lines. Tesla on the other hand is just getting started. They seems to have all the core technologies nailed and with a very solid roadmap ahead. So all in all, at this point in time, tesla seems to be a solid buy, just like amazon was 5 years ago, probably even better.  Im curious to hear counter arguments to this. I keep seeing posts about how tesla is incredibly overpriced and that was true a year or two ago but imo not anymore.\",\n",
       " \"Profited 13% today on TSLA for a total of $264, and took AMZN for a $6 loss.I recorded myself trading and reacting live. You can find the full video here: [ Recap:*First TSLA Trade*After the terrible day for the market yesterday, especially Tesla, we saw a small gap down in the morning so I anticipated a possible continuation of momentum in that direction.[TSLA 1 minute pre-market chart from this morning]( key levels I spotted were:1. Psychological whole number 690, which has constantly been a good base of support/resistance in the past2. The little trendline I drew out3. And the bounce of 685The market opened with a slight move to the upside which was then followed by a hard crash down. I always like a move in the direction opposite to the one I am trying to trade at the open, which usually always forms a better pattern and probability for the direction you are trying to play. As the market came down, TSLA broke right through the little trendline I drew out which is where I entered puts. My mental stop loss was set at the 692 area. I held the trade down through the 685 key level and sold once I saw it form the indecision candle at 6:33.Profit: $180*Amazon Trade*After my trade in TSLA, I spotted the insane amount of strength in Amazon. The market was falling hard and Amazon was pushing up![First few minutes of Amazon's chart from this morning]( was forming a little bull flag I planned on trading as long as I saw the market bounce up. If the market bounced up here, Amazon was destined to shoot high. I ended up entering calls on the green arrow as the market did in fact start to bounce at 6:36.[First few minutes of SPY's chart]( point I entered Amazon was at the second green candle on SPY's chart, I saw a potential reversal, and entered. The next candle shook me out though. It was followed by a red candle that now in hindsight, I should have waited for it to break 379.25 instead of anticipating the continued drop. It did not look too hot thought as this was the 4th candle in a row the buyers tried pushing up then to see SPY almost break the bear flag there shook me out of the trade.Loss: $6*Second Tesla Trade*Immediately following the Amazon trade, the market did in fact fall back down to break that bear flag. This is where I took the opportunity to trade TSLA again because it formed the same bear flag as the market and was very weak.[TSLA chart with entry]( bought 1 put contract at that green arrow and rode it down with the market with a target to break under 675, which it did and I ended up selling right at the bottom of the next red candle. I sold there because:1. It hit my target2. SPY was bouncing off of a level I had at 378.83 which was from the bottom of a gap that formed last week[SPY chart from today: the green arrow is the candle I sold my TSLA trade at, the yellow line is the support I got from the gap that formed last week on SPY]( $84Fills:[Same week expiration on all contracts]( post content, updates, and daily profit/losses on my instagram, twitter, and youtube.

They\\'ve used Monte Carlo as one method to help them determine that price.   # Why that is stupid:  This unconventional mathematical method is extremely powerful in the study of stochastic process. Here comes the argument on Linkedin. \"Stock price can be seemed as a [Wiener Process]( Hence, we can use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price.\" said a data science blog. Well, in order to be a Wiener Process, we have to assume the stock price is continuous in time. In reality, the market closes. The overnight volatility exists. But that is not the biggest issue here. The biggest issue is, can we really use Monte Carlo simulation to predict the stock price, even a range or its direction?The author offered a quite interesting idea. As he suggested, the first step was to run as many simulations as possible on [stochastic differential equations]( to predict stock price. The goal of simulations was to pick a best fitted curve (in translation, the smallest standard deviation) compared to the historical data. There might exist a hidden pattern in the historical log return. The best fitted curve had the potential to replicate the hidden pattern and reflect it in the future forecast. The idea sounds neat, doesn\\'t it?   Inspired by his idea, we can build up the simulation accordingly. To fully unlock the potential of Monte Carlo simulation, the ticker we pick is $GME (Gamestop), one of the best performing stocks.  If we used Monte Carlo on $GME (From January 2019, to May 2022) we would think the stock price would be roughly what it was in the beginning of 2019.....Whereas in actuality the black line shows what the stock did.   [Monte Carlo on $GME]( let\\'s look at $TSLA. If we are to use Monte Carlo on $TSLA we would think the stock price is just shy of $1500 today...when in reality it\\'s $676.59 at the time of this writing...it\\'s more than 50% off.   Cathy is most likley going to have a PT that is well over 2x what $TSLA will actually be in 2026 using stupid stuff like this, potentially 3x too high.

Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. * Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor * Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices * Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)* Have higher User battery needs (towing range).    * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer.

There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. * Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production SO WHAT?1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice.    1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand    1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries    2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future ConclusionTesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. Would love for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.\",\n",

       " \"TL/DR upfront:Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \\\\~ 2026-2028). \\\\---- Argument:Fords issues with EV profitability (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)]( ) is a PROXY for legacy auto’s outlook writ large. Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. * The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/deliveryFords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. * Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor * Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices * Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)* Have higher User battery needs (towing range).    * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. * See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network.    * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. * Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production SO WHAT?1.

The market and the ticker have to give you the opportunity and it has to be prepped beforehand.  If you are a new or newer trader please read the Wiki, never short on a green day and never go long on a red day. This review is for myself, primarily, to add a setup I liked to my playbook.  It's also so that I can see where I made mistakes and could have executed the trade better.  Because we need to improve daily, and 'good' is not enough.TSLA short, 6/24 expiration 737.5 Puts. Reversal from long position. [TraderSync]( like that I was able to flip so fast.  Take the loss, and go without thinking about whether or not I was wrong and feeling bad about seeing red. Just execute the plan.  Could improve:Again, execution timing.  I have a sale there that, in hindsight, I should have held.  My reasoning was that at 720 support it could have easily reversed.  I should have sold 1/2 of my position only and let the rest ride for the big move.  Instead I sold it all and re-entered.  I. The Big PictureMarket: The market (and the economy) is still in a precarious position.  My longer-term bias is still bearish. However, over the weekend SPY gapped up and continued upward.  Ticker: TSLA has been trading in a downward channel with algo support at \\\\~620 and resistance at \\\\~680-700.  With SPY gapping up, TSLA gapped up as well. II. Intraday Fundamentals & Technical Analysis\\\\--Market: The market had a strong open, but no green, stacking candles with little-to-no-overlap (Pete in the back of my head) on increasing volume.  It was mixed green and red and creeping up, testing 376 level and rejecting.  Continued to make higher lows but failed to attract buyers to breach and hold above 376. \\\\--Sector: No sector analysis applied to this trade.\\\\--Ticker:  TSLA had a very strong open and flew through several resistance levels: 680, 700. 720 primarily.  It came close to testing 730, but failed at around 728.  Retraced and retried, breached, and then bled out.    Trade & Account ManagementI was actually long on TSLA, building a position buy buying on the bid \\\\~720 and prepping for a potential run to 730 and continuation. It had been so strong in the am that shorting it at that moment made no sense.  However, I did prep my potential short in case the opportunity presented itself: I chose the puts, mapped out levels and prices, and had a plan.  As I was building my long position TSLA suddenly lost RS and started drifting downward.  I put in a final order at 720.5 in case it bounced and got filled.  TSLA broke support, however, and my thesis with it.   So I sold my long position at a loss and flipped short.  \\\\--Trade Instrument: Puts. 6/24 expiration.  I used puts because if TSLA broke support and volume came in, they were going to move nicely with a lot of leverage.  I pre-planned a possible breach of support with different levels and prices at which I could sell the position.  \\\\--Position Sizing: I went in full position, but was comfortable with the trade.  I sold the position on support of 720 since it had been an important level and I was unsure TSLA would break it.  When it did, I went back in for the break of VWAP.  My initial target was to sell the position at 35-35.5. I sold my final leg at 37.5.  Intuition and Emotional ReviewThis was one of those trades that had part 'feel' to it.  I felt TSLA going weaker and bleeding out, and was comfortable with my position.  In fact, I didn't go bigger because I hit the limit I set on my trade software and had no time to change it. I cursed at my screen and just went with it. Emotionally, this is a fast trade so my heart was racing a bit as TSLA hit 720 or so.  I exited 100% of my position and watched for another candle and a half before re-entering, again big.  Put in an order to sell a bit past VWAP and got filled as TSLA approached fast, volatility went up and the bid caught up.  Izzy\",\n",

There is pent up demand to rally. Naturally it is easier to make money on the way up.. I would sell into rallies. I don’t have to many recent positions because I don’t feel compelled to take part in this. I don’t see a bottom yet and we have come off super highs making it a lot tougher to trade.

What we do between now and then 3 weeks, we can have a trading range so I don’t feel compelled to make trades. I don’t see us going far lower or higher near term. You don’t have to force trades. It was of course easier to make money Nasdaq 6,000 to 16,200 and down from 16,200 to 10,500… Now the big moves may be a while. Don’t feel fomoed. We will rise higher but not sure term. I gave you some things to look for if you are a bull or bear… unfortunately near term bad data is coming… We may have to wait into 2023 for things to rise again, I wont give up on 2022 but I don’t see any reason we should rally in 2022 until October 3rd quarter earnings… and that is still not likely…. We may have to wait a year for rate hikes to stop and companies to beat earnings. I do not go against the data.Rates rising everything mortgage, home is getting crushed. Well LEN just announced earnings. What a slam. BZH slammed last quarter and even upped earnings to 5 dollars a share… I last traded this 14-16…It got slammed with the rates… May be a signal for me to go back in. LEN is a home builder leader, BZH is a smaller company.TSLA rumored to lay off 10% of workforce, signs of earnings in a month? Musk has also stated this quarter was very difficult… Will my 300 fair value hold? These are signals that a miss may be coming… it is hard to bet against a company that has a cult… This cult could be as strong as GME/AMC.. In reality a company can trade high forever until a bidder loses faith in the company or supply floods into the auctions… Which is why I am saying GME will 100% fall… they wont be making money for years…. If you do not make money for years, you have no choice but to sell shares….. I have not looked into the SEC filing for TSLA but it would not surprise me at all when they do this 3 for 1 split that they also print 5-10 billion to shaft retail… One of the best ways to shaft retail is when doing a split \\\\[make everyone happy\\\\] and then sneakily print extra shares so they don’t notice.. It is a common way.I will wait I wont feel compelled to do trades. If a stock I want to buy drops a lot, maybe I get calls or shares..

       " \"TLDR: We rally next week.  TSLA to mid 700's and BA to 170s.  After all the doom and gloom the past few weeks, bulls are looking for anything to give them hope.  Well, I may have some. I rode TSLA puts down on Thursday and hit a 5 bagger, now I've put those gains into TSLA and BA calls.  Here's why.  First off, TSLA: weekly chart shows a couple things.  First off, the MACD is turning bullish. Second, you can see that we're at an important level of historical support.  The 625 level served as support February 23, March 9 July 8, July 19, and July 27 back in 2001, and May 24/25 of this year.  We bounced off that number hard on Thursday and steadily climbed back to 650.  the daily chart, you can see a very clear double bottom that may be forming.  One thing to note is the rising RSI as the 625 low is being retested.  On 5/25, the RSI hit 30 as TSLA bounced off the 625 support level.  As we hit the same level yesterday, the RSI held around 40.  This RSI divergence is generally seen as a bullish indicator that more buyers are stepping in at this level. Now, BA: weekly chart shows that BA bounced of a significant historical support from the Covid era.  After hitting the low of 90 in March 2020, BA bounced to 186, and subsequently dropped to 115 a few weeks later, finding strong support there.  Over 2 years later, the stock found support at the exact same price, and recovering to a high 138 today. One thing to note is the volume. Almost 100 million shares were traded this week, more than the double the past couple weeks.  After the Covid crash, you can see that every time there was a significant increase in volume, Boeing ran. And when Boeing runs, it runs hard.  Additionally, you can see the MACD turning bullish.   the daily, you can see a double bottom forming, similar to TSLA.  The RSI is trending upward, and there is a gap between 162-167 that will be filled eventually, and I think that'll be soon.  Volume is consistently rising as well.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I think that BA is a fairly easy stock to manipulate.  If you look at the daily chart going back to March 2020, some of the swings are absolutely insane.  Smart money has loaded up on calls, as you can see below.  The next 2 weeks have a very bullish option chain setup.   was some significant call buying today at the 140 and 150 strikes for next Friday as well.  the market will continue to crash next week and we'll see more doom and gloom, but there has to be a decent snap back rally at some point where buyers step in, and I think these levels are where that will happen.

Infinite game. Can the competitors play the infinite game; focusing on the long-term vision, able to move fast with aggressive investment rather than meeting short-term profitability and share price expectations?  Incumbents versus startups. Can incumbents win against startups when the industry is moving towards the early phase of a new S-curve? History shows that it is difficult.Capital allocation. We need to monitor their capital allocation between reinvestment versus dividends payout and share buybacks. Tesla and the startups are all reinvesting as much as possible and not into dividends and share buybacks which the incumbents were doing pre-Covid.We are still early. Tesla’s challengers can be one of the current companies listed in this post. The challengers may exist in the form of a partnership where they work with various best-in-class (Apple, Nvidia, Mobileye, Cruise, Waymo).  Check out the post for a detailed analysis: [',\n",

       " 'As all of you who have long traded TSLA know, TSLA stock price follows laws of numerology. In particular, it has strong affinity for price points like \"$69\", \"$1337\", \"$420\" and let us not forget, \"$420.69\", which is the most powerful of these.Because the board is going to do a 3:1 split, and because we know the shareholders will almost certainly support it, we can trade options in anticipation.Quite simply, a future share at $420.69 is thus $1262.07 in current value (since $420.69 = $1262.07. Or, you can add $420.69 three times if you can\\'t do multiplication). The split sounds like it should be done by fall. So, the play is therefore to simply buy up November or October calls at $1262, or you could buy a bit lower to make sure it\\'s ITM, call it $1200. These calls in turn split into basically $420c (or $400c). I made jokes about this last time, and everyone thought I was being a moron, but had I actually done the trade I would\\'ve made 100x because the stock did in fact rally tremendously LAST time this happened, and crossed 420. Because past results are often a prediction of future performance\\\\*, we can expect TSLA stock to end up north of $420.69, since that is the nature of things.Good luck losing money on this truly moronic idea based in no valid reasoning. Remember: Tesla’s biggest product is not the model 3, but rather, its stock, and they’ll have three times as much of it. BULLISH\\\\*many exceptions always apply',\n",

Having greater access to controls/sensors/data may also enable new features/ apps. While this would be beneficial for (Apple) consumers, analysts wonder how many automakers will be willing to offer the complete set of features. Even today, there are features that CarPlay can do that automakers haven’t added the functionality. That said, having a more complete “Apple experience” in the car could be used as a selling point for some vehicles (perhaps even nameplates/brands that previously had tougher sales) and could help close the software experience gap with Tesla, Rivian and others who have their own software (and save development spend).

Place a stop loss order at say $740 to cover in case the position moves against you.If at expiry the stock is above 650 but below 705, either cover at that price or another put option can be sold and the premium again used for the stop loss cover.

Been accumulating tesla shares for a while now and I intend to keep them as long as possible.I'm low on cash so cash secured puts is probably not an option for me.   From what I gather from various sources, it seems that the consensus is  :   1. Strike > breakeven    2.Strike should be 30% away from current stock price    3. DTE 30-45 to allow max premium    4.Close position (by buying back call) at around 50%-75% profit if possible and not let it expire    5. If it gets too close to your strike, roll options (not too familiar with this point tbh)    Any other tips that I should take note of? or are there better strategies out there?  Thanks\",\n",

       " \"TLDR\\xa0: The many recent positive media pieces about GME makes me think that the stock dividend announcement sealed the deal for Wall Street and that a lot of big players already positioned themselves long during the last dip from 200$ to 85$. MOASS will be a long process, like it was for TSLA, squeezing the short slowly along the way until incredible highs over the next few years.Tesla was not always the Wall Street darling it is now. Not so long ago, all you could read about Tesla were pieces saying the company was grossly mismanaged, that it was overvalued, that it would go bankrupt, etc.At some point, surprisingly, you started to see pop up many positive spin articles in mainstream media about Tesla and its potential… and then the share price started to rise.$TSLA already had a solid community of retail investor behind it since its beginning, but a lot of big players went from short to long around that time, and the momentum switched big time, squeezing shorts along the way from its IPO in 2010 at 17$ a share (presplits, of course) and marketcap valuation of 226 millions to the behemoth (more than 2 trillions market cap at its peak last November) we know today that became a “Wall Street favorite”.The hype of the Model 3 anticipation peaked in July 2017 when Tesla started to take orders for the car that would change the destiny of the company. In a typical sell the news fashion, stock was shorted to oblivion and thousands of FUD pieces were dissiminated across mainstream media while big players, knowing it was their last opportunity to get in the train, started to build long position in the stock, until the $TSLA found a bottom in June 2019, more than 50% lower than it was the July 2017 peak.[The 2 years dip before the rip]( saw then a lot of fluff pieces and bullish spins dominating the news everywhere and the stock started its crazy reversal, slowly and mercilessly squeezing the shorts along the way from a “post split” value of 35$ per shares in July 2019 to a peak of 1240$ per share in November 2021 (3500% runnup in price in bit more than 2 years).[The rip]( think what we are witnessing right now is start of what will be many more fluff pieces about Gamestop and its incredible business reversal led by Ryan Cohen. The narrative is beautiful and will be an easy sell to the general population since everybody loves an underdog story. Things are already into place. Maybe we’ll see a last dip attempt around earnings, but I think it is game over already. The big dogs are in my opinion almost all long at this point.It is of course baseless smooth brain speculation and I'm dumb as a rock, so take it with gigantic grain of salt. However, a bit of titties jacking is always fun!\",\n",

From a technical point of view, googl, msft, and aapl are more technical.This is actually the opposite of what the stock market wants to do, the opposite of value investing. I think this exposes the conspiracy of false traps again. Because everyone just wants to hype tsla and amzn. Real players and long-term buyers institutional investors believe now is not the time to buy.We must always understand that the main investors in the market are still institutional investors, accounting for more than 80%. These institutional investors have a professional analysis team, so they must have a thorough understanding of the market.They're not going to give up on companies with lower valuations and stronger technology, but as things stand, they're clearly not going to buy in bulk.

       " 'Wrote about this in a comment on another thread. Buying some TSLA $550 calls this week with a Nov 18th expiration and selling calls against them until the share price recovers or corrects for the long term. In my estimation the current share price is not necessarily the floor, especially considering the Twitter deal, and [Elon’s margin loan linked to TSLA]( However, now that he’s reduced the margin loan by 50% (6.5B) there should be less downside speculation. Considering that whenever TSLA breaks out it happens relatively quickly, long term ITM calls have a higher potential upside than puts and premium prices are still quite good.I saw some analysis here about taking quick puts and going in and out, but not much about long term leaps or puts. I’m still bullish on TSLA long term even though it was severely overbought and see this recent fiasco with Twitter and Elon as a solid profit opportunity.If anyone is going bearish long term I’d love to hear your thoughts on why and vice versa.EDIT 1: I listed this in a comment below but I’ll put it here as well. After assessing my plan again and zooming out to look at the broader market, I decided to change plans. Below I’ll list how and why.“However after running potential scenarios using IV vs HV, evaluating the current financial climate around Tesla, and creating a cost benefit analysis using the Greeks, I’ve decided to use this same strategy with a different stock. I’d be able to make the same profit in the short term (1-3 months) while giving up some potential upside in the long term. The reason for this was as somebody else mentioned in this thread, Twitter is a very big unknown and I don’t feel secure risking so much money on something as volatile as Tesla when I could be making similar profit with significantly less risk on multiple contracts in a stock like AMD or AAPL. Hope that’s helpful and best of luck.”',\n",

       " \"Billionaire Leo Koguan, who describes himself as the third-largest individual shareholder of Tesla stock, has called on the automaker to announce a $15 billion share buyback as the company's stock price continues to fall.In a tweet to Martin Viecha, Tesla's senior director of investor relations, Koguan said the company should immediately announce plans to buy back $5 billion of Tesla stock this year and $10 billion next year. He added that Tesla should use its free cash flow to fund the buyback and should not affect its existing $18 billion cash hoard.In a follow-up tweet, Koguan said Tesla had free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of this year. He added that after accounting for capital spending, he expects it to climb to $8 billion this year and $17 billion next year.Tesla shares closed down more than 6 percent on Wednesday amid a broad market sell-off. The company's shares have fallen more than 30% this year. Tesla was down slightly in early trading Thursday.

The analyst said that Tesla has lost some market share in 2021 due to strong market growth.Also, sales of high-priced products like the Model S and Model X have fallen due to competition and cannibalization from cheaper new Tesla products. He emphasized that it is generally difficult to increase sales of electric vehicle models that have been on the market for more than five years. For Tesla, delaying the launch of new models will be a potential risk.Earlier, according to SEC filings, Tesla CEO Elon Musk sold about 4.415 million Tesla shares from April 26 to 27, cashing out a total of $3.99 billion.

Even though it's down \\\\~40% from ATH, it's still faring better than the likes of SHOP, and tons of other tech small caps, and I know it won't stay down here for long.However, something I've always struggled with is how to evaluate the key-man risk that Elon represents to the company, which I believe to be the only risk that TSLA faces in the short/mid term.  Here are my main thoughts:\\\\- He's a generational visionary, and the reason why many people invest in TSLA. I believe if he stays healthy and involved, TSLA will be the largest market cap stock within the next 10 years.\\\\- However he's gradually attracting more attention; from the negative sentiments surrounding the Twitter deal to receiving threats from Russian actors, the target on his back is growing bigger.Here's how I think of quantifying the key-man risk:\\\\- During any given year, there's a small but real chance that something bad could happen to Elon, (health, accidents, etc) let's say it's 2%.\\\\- If that happens, how would TSLA stock react? My guess is an immediate 20-40% haircut, for various reasons. Not to mention Earth would lose one of the most valuable human beings alive.\\\\- Therefore, in any given year, my portfolio could see a 10-20% drop from this key-man risk alone. (50% allocation \\\\* 20-40% haircut). This would be on top of any drawdown caused by macro conditions.\\\\- It may take many years for Tesla to prove that the culture and roadmap Elon has built was robust enough to take the company to his original vision, if it can find a capable operator (like a Tim Cook) to take over.I understand that everyone has their own risk tolerance. I would love to hear what you evaluate the key-man risk to be in number, and how to manage that risk. Thanks!\",\n",

       " 'Nu ved jeg, at jeg bliver downvoted fordi at jeg ikke er enig med mængden, men hear me out.Er TSLA en af de mest undervalued aktier i sp 500 lige nu? (Hov vent med at downvote). TSLA har en forward P/E på 70, og nærmer sig Amazon, Nvidia osv. Jeg kunne klart forstå folk der mente at den var overvalued da P/E var på 1400+.Deres P/E er faldet drastisk fordi de gror gns omsætning på 70% (og stigende) YoY, og er dermed den hurtigst groende large cap virksomhed, har projektionen til at gøre det mange år endnu. Deres margins på bilsalg er vanvittige 30+% (og stigende) sammenlignet med “almindelige” bilmærker på under 10%. Deres fremtidige batteriproduktion planer og salgsplaner tyder på at de i 2030 vil sælge 20mio biler om året (lige nu sælger de ca. 1 mio).Ulempen er så, at rigtig meget afhænger af Elon musk. Hvad hvis han skulle risikere at gå af, eller andre uforudsete faktorer.Jeg går ud fra, at rigtig mange er uenige i kommentarerne, så min plan er egentlig at genbesøge dette tweet om 5 år og se hvad der er sket.EDIT: indtil videre er bedste argument at “konkurrenterne kommer” og “Teslaer er grimme”.Jeg er helt med på, at der kommer mange spillere på markedet, især mår de store bilmærker går all in. Men det er vigtigt for mig at pointere, at hvis de kunne lave 5 mil elbiler om året, så havde de gjort det. Der er en grund til, at de fleste store bilfabrikanter ikke kan lave over 100.000 elbiler om året. De har ikke dele og batterier til det. Flaskehalsen er batterier, og dem der kan producerer/køber flest batterier i fremtiden, de sælger flest elbiler. Tesla har i deres nye fabrikker integreret egen batteriproduktion, hvorimod andre bilfabrikanter håber på at kunne købe nok. Det kan de ikke, ellers havde de kunnet producere mange flere elbiler end hvad de gør nu.Men hvem ved, måske jeg tager fejl og blot er en tosse på reddit.',\n",

       " \"I used to get downvoted for posts and comments about Tesla but I've noticed that people are willing to discuss it more reasonably now. I welcome all points of view. But tonight I wrote out my Long TSLA thesis and I figured it was worth sharing.Assume that Tesla hits Wall Street estimates for 2022 Deliveries this year (bear in mind that Tesla has consistently outperformed Wall Street expectations, so this is likely conservative). That would be 1,460,906 deliveries. Tesla states that they will be able to comfortably surpass 50% delivery increase YoY for the next several years even with current supply chain bottlenecks. This is not a pie-in-the-sky Full Self Driving promise, this is the expectation that he has laid out in the past that Tesla has delivered on consistently, despite Covid issues and supply chain issues. This would be 2,191,359 deliveries in 2023 and 3,287,039 deliveries in 2024. This is likely conservative, given that Tesla has been supply chain constrained for the past year and still achieved 69% YoY growth, they have two new huge factories in Berlin and Austin ramping up, and Shanghai is going to add 450,000 cars/year capacity (announced yesterday).For purposes of this DD, we will assume that (EPS/car delivered) will remain at Q1 2022 level despite Tesla's strong uptrend in margin. Beginning in Q2, we will see the Average Sale Price of a Tesla increase dramatically as the price increases that were introduced months ago finally start to have their cars delivered. But let's keep it conservative. Based on Q1 2022, the ratio was 3.22 EPS  / 310,048 cars = 0.00001039.If we use the above EPS/Car ratio on the conservative 50% YoY delivery estimates for 2023 and 2024, we get:2023 EPS 22.76 (45% above current Wall Street Consensus of 15.62)2024 EPS 34.14 (75% above current Wall Street Consensus 19.43)\\\\*Consensus # source: Bloomberg\\\\* (Note that it is normal for Wall Street to underestimate Tesla earnings like this. EPS estimates for 2022 and 2023 have gone up 50% since 12/31/2021--as share price dropped 18% along with the rest of the market)The next question is: What is an appropriate P/E for Tesla in 2024 when they deliver nearly 3.3 million cars per year? Some will argue that Tesla will be ending their hyper growth stage and should see an appropriate P/E compression. Perhaps that's fair, but everything points to growth remaining strong throughout the decade. Elon has stated that Tesla's goal is 20 million cars produced by 2030, which would mean sustained 35% growth from 2025 to 2030 after growing 50% per year in 2023 and 2024. Based on my EPS estimate above, at TSLA's current price, at the end of year in 2024 share price would be:$1024.20 at 30 P/E$1,707 at 50 P/E$3,414 at 100 P/E$4,028 at current P/E of 118Remember, this is all based purely on EV deliveries, and Tesla has a proven track record of consistently hitting goals and the company is developing into an agile EV manufacturing monster. Here's where it gets nutty...Elon has repeatedly stated that he believes Full Self Driving (100K full self driving beta testers on road today ... goal of no-steering-wheel and no-pedal Robotaxi in production in 2024 as stated in Q1 2022 earnings call) will be worth more than the EV production business discussed at length above. Think: chauffeur service at a cost per mile of travel that is less than the cost/mile of owning a car-- and eventually less cost per mile of a subsidized bus ticket.Elon also believes that the Optimus project they have in development (with the goal of replacing jobs with menial tasks--similar to how FSD replaces driving) will be larger than both the car business and the Robotaxi business. How much would a company be willing to pay for a Robot that can replace 3-4 $35K+benefit salaries per year? How much would a transport company be willing to pay for a Semi that dramatically reduces gas cost and can replace the cost of paying two $100K/year semi truck driver salaries each year?I understand that a belief that Full Self Driving and Optimus will come to fruition requires a lot of faith in Elon Musk's ability to get things done that have never been done before. And I agree it's probably unreasonable to think that the potential numbers for these projects should be thrown into the current valuation. But as a shareholder, you should appreciate the fact that Tesla is making progress on projects that could double or triple its EV-maker valuation, and these projects are being pursued under the leadership of \\\\*arguably\\\\* the greatest visionary of our time with nearly unlimited capital and first pick of Engineering and AI talent.You can do the math on what will happen if Tesla develops 1 (or 2) businesses that eclipse the profitability of their car production. But the purpose of this was to show that it is well worth being invested in Tesla even for the car business alone. And by investing for the cars, you gain exposure to the moon shot possibility of either FSD or Optimus. Disclaimer: I'm not qualified whatsoever to give out any advice or analysis. I have invested in TSLA since 2018 and my portfolio is... very heavily weighted toward TSLA.Thanks for reading! :-)\",\n",

When they do TSLA, will finally have the long-awaited crash that everyone has been predicting.The only was I can see Elon getting himself out of this conundrum is if he can make TSLA the next AAPL. That has been his strategy so far, basically to make it a premium brand/luxury good that people will pay for disregarding the cost. It remains to be seen whether he can pull this off.But if the market starts getting fractured and Tesla can't maintain its dominance, the stock price will crash dramatically just like Netflix did.The play: YOLOing far OTM puts on the first sign of TSLA weakness could be the move here.

Would love to hear others\\' opinions. Some of the key pints from the article are below. [Is The End Near For Tesla And Other Meme-Stocks? (forbes.com)]( \"26% of the company’s GAAP earnings in 2021 were from the sale of regulatory credits, not from the underlying economics of making and selling vehicles and other ancillary services. Once incumbents increase production of EVs they will need to purchase fewer credits from Elon. That means Tesla needs to actually start *selling* *cars* to make money. The catch-22 is that for the company to sell more cars, it first needs to increase its production capacity.\"\"Tesla’s first-mover advantage has long been cited as reason enough for investors to pile their money into the company. However, that advantage is gone, and in some cases turning into a lag. Ford (F), Rivian (RIVN), and General Motors (GM) aim to produce EV trucks in 2022, but Tesla will be on the sidelines until at least 2023 before launching its Cybertruck.\"\"Tesla’s share of the U.S. EV market fell from 79% in [2020]( to 70% in [2021]( With [light truck sales]( comprising more than three out of every four vehicles sold in the U.S. in January 2022, Tesla falling behind in truck EVs means its share of the U.S. market could fall further. \"\"Despite the increased competition, failure to meet delivery expectations, and diminutive share of the global EV market in 2021, Tesla’s valuation implies the company will own 57% of the global passenger EV market in 2030.Even if Tesla increases the average selling price (ASP) per vehicle to $55K vs. ($49K in 2021), Tesla’s stock price at \\\\~$1,100/share implies the firm will sell 15 million vehicles in 2030 versus \\\\~936k in 2021. That figure represents 57% of the [projected base case global EV passenger vehicle market]( in 2030 and the implied vehicle sales based on a lower ASP looks even more unrealistic.\"\"...should Tesla’s stock price ever reflect realistic expectations for the company, authorities may feel emboldened to pursue legal or regulatory action against Musk and/or Tesla.\"',\n",

       " ' #### Key points:* Elon Musk has sold $4 billion of Telsa stock* Presumably to finance the Twitter deal* Should we, therefore, buy TSLA stock?* Will Rivian (RIVN) Be A Big Winner If People Are Jumping From Tesla?Elon Must has sold $4 billion of Tesla (NASDAQ: TLSA) stock so is this a signal that we should be buying into Tesla? Which actually sounds like a strange sort of question, why should we buy in when a major holder is selling? The answer being that perhaps that seller, Musk, has stopped selling.The point here is to be trading upon a technical point, not a fundamental or structural one. Sure, we should consider [Tesla’s ]( in the EV space, for those fundamentals do always matter. But the idea here, the thought, isn’t about that at all. Rather, it’s about Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter. What effect is that going to have on the price of Tesla’s stock?To grapes this we need to understand Musk’s own finances. Yes, he’s the world’s richest man. But there is very little to no cash there, it’s all in the stock of his varied enterprises – Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and whatever that AI one is called. So, the Twitter bid calls for $44 billion to come from somewhere. That’s more than even the world’s richest man has to hand of course.So, some of that is coming in the form of loans. But at least some of it needs to come from Musk himself – he’s committed to $21 billion in equity financing. There’s also $12.5 billion in debt to be secured against Musk’s Tesla shares.Well, OK, all of this is achievable, for sure. But there is that influence on TSLA to consider – which, since we’re considering the Tesla stock price here seems sensible. At one level, there’s that pledge of Telsa stock against the loan. If something goes wrong with Twitter then that could be called and the holding would presumably be liquidated. That wouldn’t be good but that’s also something which, if it even happens, is somewhere down the road in the middle distance at closest.The other question is, well, how much Tesla stock is Musk going to sell now to produce what portion of that $21 billion in equity he’s got to find? Which is the very thing which has cut the Tesla stock price by some 10 to 13% since the Twitter issue first started. Having a major holder looking to unload a substantial stake will do that to a corporate share price.At which point we’ve had our answer – Musk has sold $4 billion of Tesla stock. At which point TSLA goes back up again – it’s up $30, or 3.4%, premarket this morning. The point being here not that Musk has sold stock, it’s that he’s said, having done so, that he has no plans for more such sales in the near future.Musk’s Twitter deal required that $4 billion, perhaps – but it doesn’t require more. So, the selling pressure on TSLA stock is now alleviated. That is, it is true that Musk selling Telsa stock isn;t a positive for the TSLA stock price, but Musk having sold stock and saying that’s it – for the moment – is a positive. So, it’s not the sale, but the indication of no more sales by Musk that might make us think it’s time to get back into Tesla.',\n",

       " 'Real life ironman - Elon Musk, has finally announced why he’s stepped back from Space X, his most beloved companies. His new venture, called\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0has seen invest over 2 billion dollars in just the past 2 years - to develop and code\\xa0[TSLA Token]( we go into the details of what\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0is, let’s talk about who Elon Musk is. Elon Musk is an entrepreneur and business magnate.But now, Elon has decided to partly withdraw from running Amazon, in order to focus on his new venture in the financial sector. That\\'s why he’s acquired\\xa0[TSLA Token]( exactly is\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0?\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0Best Digital Token & Better than any other Digital SolutionIf you were to take ALL of the world\\'s computers and link them,\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0would still be hundreds of times more powerful. Elon decided to put all of this power to work in a financial technology with the plan of redistributing the world’s wealth.Basically, to take from the top 0.1% and give back to the 99.9%.\\xa0Elon believes wealth is not distributed well in our time and the problem is getting worse. Although there will always be someone richer and someone poorer,\\xa0the current situation is unacceptable – where the top 0.1% controls almost 90% of world\\'s wealth. He believes he can cut that down to around 20% without causing world-wide financial crisis. So, what exactly does that mean to you, just a regular person? This means you’ll become 2 - 3 times wealthier, and no one except the super-wealthy will take a hit. Sounds amazing, doesn\\'t it? Not for the super-wealthy, but for you – yes! Ok, the theory is there, but how will it work you might ask?Overall, the idea is easy. The top 0.1% keep their wealth invested in stocks, and Wall Street brokers trade these stocks for them. The idea is to beat the Wall Street traders at their own game - making winning trades so Wall Street with their hoard of wealth slowly but surely starts losing. Just like a poker game, where a new player comes along on the high-stakes table and starts winning.In order to do this normally, you’d need a better stock movement predictions than what Wall Street currently has (virtually impossible). Now, with the help of TSLA Token computing, it can be done, and it\\'s actually being done now as\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0has shown! This is exactly the reason why Musk jumped on this technology as soon as he heard about it.\\xa0It\\'s revolutionary. interviewed TSLA Token CTO Elon Musk so he can better explain how TSLA Token operates. the interview Elon showed us [TSLA Token](\\xa0in action. It was like seeing a real miracle taking place before our eyes. Elon software was making on autopilot. Elon was so confident in his software in partnership with TSLA, that he offered to give us one free membership so we could run our own independent tests, and so we did.Can you tell us how TSLA Token works?TSLA Token works like a team of hundreds of cities.\\xa0We have millions of automated citizens in each city that go in to crypto market, they spend 12 hours a day gathering information. In the evening, these ‘cities’ come together to exchange and compare what they gathered. Then what we call ‘kings of the cities’ analyze all information and try to find mistakes in the crypto market; by finding a mistake, we can predict the crypto trends. Once we have a certain trending topic related to a big company, we analyze if the trend is positive or negative.  If the trend is positive, we bet on the crypto to rise, if the trend is negative - we bet on the crypto to fall.\\xa0It’s that simple.How often does TSLA Token make a mistake?TSLA Token computing is very different to everyday PCs. If a normal computer has one or two CPUs(processor), then TSLA Token consists of millions of CPUs. If a mistake is made, the CPUs analyze the outcome and \"VOTE\" which decision is the mistake and which is the real deal.\\xa0We are still in the Beta stage of our TSLA Token computer and software, but it’s already showing over 91% successful trades.\\xa0This means that out of 100 trades TSLA Token makes automatically, around 91 will be profitable.How much money can a regular user of TSLA Token make?It depends a lot on the money they invest and the brokers they work with.\\xa0Let’s take the regular user who starts with 250$ and bets 20$ per trade. Over 24 hours, TSLA Token will make around 200 trades based(this is limited by user) on information gathered by TSLA Token. Around 182 of the trades will be profitable, 18 will not.\\xa0This means the user will earn approximately 3,480$ and lose around 520$.\\xa0Evening out to 2,960$ profit in a single day. There are some small commissions added by the broker, but it’s usually less than 2%.Has any user actually lost his investment? No, we have never had a user who has lost more than he put in. Even the worst cases we have had always been profitable in the end.What improvements are you working on right now?There are many we’re currently working on, but Elon insisted I not share them yet. Stay tuned though – it’s going to get even better than it already is now!How much will it cost to use TSLA Token automated system?We don’t know yet – it fully depends on running costs and where we want to take the technology. But the first 1,000 spots will be\\xa0free – we want people to help us test it (and make money while they do so). After that, for regular users, we’re thinking of charging $10,000.00 monthly and more than ten times as much for those trading firms who wish to use TSLA Token regularly across their business. We do not want to disrupt the stock market too much so spots will be limited to 500 trading firms and 50,000 regular users.When will TSLA Token be available?Very soon. We’re just adding finishing touches and the first members will be welcome very soon. First, we’ll open the doors for small traders - regular people, and only later for big trading firms. Again, the first 1,000 people will get a\\xa0lifetime membership for free.\\xa0Alex Woods, 24We took one of our intern students, Alex Woods, and told him to sign up, following each step provided by Elon.The first step was easy - he needed to fill in some details like his name, last name, email and phone number. After the form was completed and submitted, he was taken to\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0dashboard. Everything seemed pretty easy so far.The next step was to fund the trading account with a trusted broker.\\xa0[TSLA Token](\\xa0selected verified broker for Alex. As we were navigating to the deposit page, Alex received a phone call from his personal account manager wanting to assist in the funding and setup process. With the help of his account manager, the funding process didn’t take long, as all major Credit Cards like VISA, MasterCard and American Express were accepted. Alex went ahead and deposited 250$. Once funded, we navigated to the “Auto Trader” section of software, set the trade amount to recommended 20$ and enabled it.

       " 'Good morning everyone. The news yesterday with – GDP was huge. It is not the only piece of news. What you must do if you are trading long term is piece data together, use your experience to gather a real good consensus on where the market is headed. I knew about this many months ago but the idea is to train and help others. At the end of the day you should all know if you do not I am not here for fans. I am actually disliked by many… and it is very amusing to me because you rather someone lie to you and tell you, you can also be a trader, quit your job, you can turn 10,000 a year to 50,000 and then 50,000 to 250,000 next year. I understand, people want to make money quick. They want to make it easy, so that is the way to get more followers, likes. You can see that on Reddit when people post stories about what they made from nothing, when they write posts about GME, AMC, SPRT, or even ATER at Ultimatetraders. Trust me, I am not here to gain likes or Karma and this in the beginning was a 60 day experiment after 1/27/2021. I did feel very good about helping those that wanted to learn. My hopes is at the end of the day people that hated me for AMC, GME, DKNG, HOOD, etc look back at my posts, at my daily plays, and even if you still don’t like me then, you say….Man, Nathan was right, what he said made a lot of sense, why didn’t I want to see, didn’t want to listen… how come I was so harsh on someone who just tried to help me… and for free!!! I have an elite team, there are 30 of us, most of them do make small donations to see my trades before hand and after hand. There are some that havent made a donation in a few months, it isn’t about the money for me, I am still trying to assist. I will however have to remove people by June that havent made a donation for some time. It is small donations anyway….. What I am training you are things that costs me thousands…. Thousands. In the year 2000 with the dot com bust I lost 75% of my portfolio about 330k I sold everything and pretty much locked up myself for 3 months, I didn’t go out, I didn’t trade in that time. I analyzed everything…..I still do. When I lose on a trade I do not just let it go, I analyze everything. I made a lotto bet on FB earnings. I only spent 200….. Yesterday, FB opened 35+ higher. I tried to take advantage of the gap up to sell my calls at 2 dollars. I paid 50 cents… I changed my order around 10AM but it was to late… Now I am down…. What did I do? Last time I bought lottos January of 2022 on BBBY. I went back and studied volume on options, high and low of days…. What did I discover? WE ARE LOSING GAMBLERS!!!! In January, 1 day before earnings I bought BBBY calls \\\\[Check Daily plays back then, do some DD\\\\] The stock was at 14 and my calls were 20 strike. The earnings were bad but somehow the stock hit 16. \\\\[so the stock was up 2 dollars….the Calls doubled!\\\\] I paid 20 cents and I was able to sell them for 40 cents.. There was little chance BBBY would hit 20! But gamblers took my calls for 40 cents to ride this bet……… Yesterday at 209, FB calls high was near 70 cents! I was in at 50 cents the stock was 175!!!! Now the stock is 209 and my calls up 20 cents?? What gives? WE HAVE LOST THE GAMBLERS! Some of the traders have been burned out of the market and I was not aware because I don’t play lottos!.... the point? I STUDIED! I ANALZYED. I was very angry and wanted to know what happened. Last week one of us tried to single me out \\\\[4/20 Daily Plays you can read the comment\\\\] The person said they don’t care about analysis, they make money and don’t need to read a report….. what I have to say to that is what I told about 5 people yesterday. Everything depends on the market. We do not control the market. This is not the market to scalp and day trade. You will get burned! I follow over 50 traders on Twitter. When the Nasdaq was making new highs and flying everyone was a genius, scalping trades…. Now some of them do not tweet for days!!! Can someone still scalp in this and make money? Sure…. But the probability is extremely low.. if you do not sell by end of day, you can wake up down 50% in your grenade… heck if you sell end of the day you can be down 25%! In a bull run you will have more speculators, gamblers, people willing to take the plunge/risks, less fear… STUDY! Can people still make money on grenades, absolutely, but the risks is way higher now… as people lose money! Who will take the plunge with you? What did I learn from a mere 200 bet? That we have definitely lost a ton of risk takers. I had expected with FB 209 I would sell my calls for 2 dollars at open. The fact that high was 70 cents when the stock was on fire, tells me stories… The volume was far higher on lottos in January…. People were buying out of the money like $1 scratch offs…. No more way out of the money Lottos for me! The stock was 175 I figured if the stock hits 200 I will get 2 for my calls. I didn’t even check prices for 200 strike, I bought 225 strike because my experience months ago with BBBY. For all I know, 200 strike was just 1 dollar! I figured 50 cents to bet and if this hits 200 based on previous experience I will get 400% I like those odds! We all make mistakes, what do we learn from them? What do we see from others? Do we learn from other’s mistakes or do we have to experience them ourselves?On 2/4/2022 a day after last earnings on AMZN I wrote that analysts and money managers were wrong. That report was a failure and an indicator of worse to come! [ I feel things will head worse for AMZN and judging by these earnings so far most companies! As I wrote yesterday it isn’t all companies, we have 9,000 \\\\[Respectable companies and maybe 2-3,000 OTC of the 10,000 are tradeable in a bull market\\\\] What did I see in the AMZN report? It is in the daily plays of that day. I spent 90 mins analyzing AMZN. I banked on puts… It is something you should and need to do to win long term. A bear market requires different thinking and trading. As it stands in 2019 pre pandemic as I said on a busy day I made 2-4 rounds… In 2020/2021 I made I believe my highest was near 30 rounds…… This is not normal… my record was over 110 rounds in a day and 96 rounds on 1 stock! That day I did trade like 5 stocks, this was the 90s and I was a kid. I didn’t want to look up \\\\[The facts, data presented\\\\] the funny thing is when I started I did everything by the book and made a trade every few months and by the phone, that was 1994! When I got AOL and Internet in 1997, I was getting real time quotes, I stopped with the blue chips and was throwing grenades… then the dot com bust! I learned my lesson. I am not purely a value investor, I go with what the market tells me. If we are flying higher I will pay more than my general rule of 60x. I may even buy companies that lose money… heck in July of 2021 after SPRT, I was throwing grenades like DATS, ATER, BBIG, TMC daily! In October I saw the signs that I must pull away from grenades.. You can read daily plays then or see videos then for why. It is in the readings, the videos… So 1 of my newer videos is the stock market will never ever change. That is because the largest shareholders of any 1 company are controlled by either a large entity or even worse the company itself…The most frightening thing is the company if in dire financials can print an endless supply of shares, crushing your auction for your security… I don’t think I wrote it here, but I told my generals that if Musk was smart he would have dumped 40+ billion of shares on the day of earnings and after… Volume was high, retail was fooled and amused…. Instead he sold 4/26 to the tune of 4.4 million shares for 4 billion… The range from 870-1,000. Avg closer to 900 because most of the shares were dumped as it fell…. Now there are 4.4 million shares extra in circulation. These shares come from the treasury and are counted in executive compensation, they come free for insiders… In the case of the new 15 billion in options Musk will pay about 50 dollars which is 0 because he will just dump onto retail…. To them they don’t care what price they sell at, because it is all FREE!!! When retail acts like an army they must concentrate, have faith in a neighbor that cant even pay rent next month… Then 1 big shareholder, getting shares for free can kill an army of millions…..I would hope Musk is smart. \\\\[I believe he is smart, but a con man\\\\] and he knows his stock is artificially inflated, and maybe he doesn’t know how the stock market works. The volume as so high on 4/20 and 4/21 he could have offloaded 35+ million shares on innocent retail and the stock would have went from 1,100 to maybe 975, but he probably doesn’t know how the market works.. That is ok though, and doesn’t mean you aren’t intelligent more than 99.9% of people do not know what you guys know, possibly thru me… the way the auction works, bid, asks, using the right days, news to unload, in a sneaky way… ….Now, Musk sales will be alerted and it will be hard for me to unload that many shares. Musk owns over 150 million shares still! Musk is lying again, it isn’t his choice to sell or not… at 800 he will get a margin call to raise cash…\\\\[guess what, he has no cash! Stock is used as a currency\\\\]…. At 570 his shares used as collateral will be liquidated… That is not his choice.. that is the market’s… As I have said before, I will say it again, TSLA at the moment is worth 300 and only because the stock business, nothing else! Can it be worth more, maybe, but in the future. \\\\[I will do a video about this and how intelligent Cathie and Ryan Cohen are\\\\] I said months ago NFLX was worth 180…… I said over a year ago that AMZN is worth 1,700… you can check! That doesn’t mean stocks will fall to fair value… this is an auction…however, do remember when big sellers are forced to sell, supply for a stock goes up, big time!For Bitcoin to be worth 100k, there has to be people willing to pay 100k. I find it silly when people and analysts on TV say its an inflation hedge, or it’s the only real currency. I recall the CEO of MSTR almost guaranteeing 100K on Bitcoin by 2021… I was laughing my ass off… So much so that he took out tons of money to buy Bitcoin, his average is near 38-39k…hope he doesn’t get a margin call…. The point is, just because people say it, doesn’t mean people will bid it and pay it! Everyone wants to sell Bitcoin for 100K but who will pay it? You need an equal amount of people bidding and asking otherwise if sellers outweigh the buyers the stock or coin will fall… that’s a guarantee.. What is a guarantee of a stock????If a company makes money, has money, the stock is low, the company will buy shares, raise dividends/special dividend. Insiders wont sell…. If a company loses money they will sell! Even more so if they lose money and the stock is high! THEY WILL UNLOAD!! That will go until the end of time! There is no way I can think of how that can be changed because if a company goes public it is for them as a company to access cash and insiders to be able to sell…… So now you are going to tell public companies and insiders they cant sell?? Whey be public?? Thank god HOOD took advantage when they did with their IPO, They had secondary sales around 60+… Wood was buying! Hopefully you weren’t…. Disaster!AAPL earnings last quarter were a 90. The were close to beating top and bottom by 10%...Notice the beats are getting more slight. This is a 75-80… I have to be honest. They are barely beating by more than 3%... It is natural for large companies not to grow, not to beat as much… hence every PE, EVERY COMPANY! Will come into reality, eventually… Not 95 not 99% of companies… every single company 100% will come to reality in time.. You find me a company that has been around for 20 years with 100x PE the entire time…..If they experience rapid growth and earnings naturally the PE will expand, but when it contracts, the market contracts so will the PE! Want to buy something like ATER with no PE and wont make money for 18+ months… Good luck! You can make money but be careful in this…. BZH beat bottom line by 100% check it out! No fud! They been slamming but market doesn’t care… I expect a big buyer, BZH themselves or the market to wake up soon. If it falls I will buy shares and wait. LNTH, I traded this last 2+ years ago it was stuck around 20-30…. NOW THEY ARE MAKING CASH! Added to plays, check those earnings, POW! I do not feel forced to trade, people do ask what I am doing. I am trading ONEW daily, 4-5x PE… I was trying to trade BBD, low PE and high dividend. I am very spooked about my puts 4/14…. I had CVNA for instance 5 contracts I paid almost 2,500 for…. 4/14 95 strike, if you check the next day 5/20 95 strike they are near 35-40! So 2 weeks later my 0 is 20,000. SPOOKED! 11 out of my 12 puts would be in the money and big time! The only put that I lost on was PANW! China said early morning that they will be ok with the auditing of US traded ADRs so the Chinese stocks may rally. For me, for now only options on Chinese stocks, I will wait.5 Trade ideas:BZH – I trade this a lot but its been several weeks, wow what a report, home builder, 3x PE but destroying earningsLNTH – testing, diagnostic health care company, what a report, and guidance, let us see, I like buying strong companies not dips on losers!AMZN – Wow what awful report. If this 2,700+ I want puts.. Previously, I didn’t buy calls but got puts every time 3,050+…. This may see 2,000 however I do not like the risk reward at 2,580… I am not confidence the cult will crackATUS – I actually still have shares of this cable company at 21+. I didn’t average down, earnings yesterday were good, not great but good, The stock just dipped to a 52 week low 9.78, but earnings are turning. I may average down to near 15 and sell my whole lot at 13 to take a small loss. It may take time for positive sentiment, but this is a start. They make money but it is out of favor, based on this turn around I see fair value at 23 still, but its hated!BBD – This baby is going 3.70+ at the moment. I have 5k at 3.63.

       " \"The purpose of this post is to 1) remind people that short naked put can have significant risk - people call this pick up pennies in front of a steamroller for a reason. 2) share my plan & reasoning in case this might help others in similar situations.Disclaimer: I'm long TSLA so my opinions might be biased. Please take the content here with a grain of salt, and not financial advice.Position: Short TSLA Apr 29 920 Put  Account size: 50k, have extra cash to top up if needed  Credit collected: $716  Unrealized PnL at Apr 28 close: 4350-716 = - $3634If you are in a similar situation, i.e. big loss compared to the premium you received & options are expiring. DO NOT PANIC. Calm down and re-evaluate your strategy & the company. In my case, if my views or the company fundamentals have changed, I would re-consider my position in the company. But that's not the case, and nothing has changed. Apparently, I don't have a crystal ball and the stock can tank much lower given its high volatility. Because I don't know how the stock is going to move, I choose to stick with my plan and just keep selling put for now.5 ways to handle expiring ITM puts - going with #5 tmr (Apr 29) before the market closes1. Close and take the loss - No. I want to stay long in TSLA so it's either stocks or options and I want to be in the stock instead of timing the market.2. Take assignment - No. due to (margin) account size limitations. A short put requires less buying power than buying 100 shares straight.3. Roll out put and add a short call - No. This turns the trade into a short strangle. My overall bias is long and I don't want to worry about stock potentially breaching the short call strikes. I chose not to add a short call. My backtests also suggest that consistently selling calls in TSLA is an unprofitable strategy.4. Roll out and down - Yes but only if rolling at a credit (i.e. collect at least a small amount of premium, and not pay a debit for the trade.) Note one advantage of rolling down is that the new option at lower strikes will have more extrinsic value than those at higher strikes.5. Roll out and at the same strike - Yes. Although the premium is higher, there's also less extrinsic value (theta) in this 920P vs. for example, the 850P. So this is a theta play with a long directional bias.

       " 'The reasons are exactly the same. Nothing new at all.I remember an old trader\\'s joke: “Man, did I tell you three months ago that the situation in the stock market couldn\\'t get worse? So, then everything was just great.”Following the results of yesterday\\'s trading session:*- S&P 500 (\\\\^GSPC) fell 2.81%,**- Dow Jones Industrial Average (\\\\^DJI) by 2.38%,**- NASDAQ Composite (\\\\^IXIC) by 3.95%, and**- Russell 2000 (\\\\^RUT) by 3.26%.**- Crude Oil Jun 22 (CL=F) rose 3.60%, and Gold Jun 22 (GC=F) rose 0.58%.*What was the trigger for the fall this time? All the same three horsemen of the Apocalypse:* growth of inflation expectations, * fears of slowdown in economic growth* weak corporate reports.To be honest, one should not call the reports of leading US corporations weak. It looks like investors got a little bit carried away.For example, despite the fact that the revenue of the US corporation Alphabet (GOOG) grew in the first quarter of this year by 23% (Y/Y), the technology giant\\'s stocks fell by more than 6% in the postmarket. This is how investors reacted to increased costs, as well as a slowdown in the growth of advertising revenue from YouTube ($6.87 billion instead of the projected $7.4 billion). Overall, EPS was ([ $24.62 vs. $25.71 expected. The fall was not stopped by the fact that the Board of Directors authorized a $70 billion share buyback.As for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), the company\\'s net income for the first nine months of the 2021-2022 financial year ending March 31, 2022 increased by 25% (G Q3 revenue increased 20% YoY to $146.405 billion. Intelligent Cloud third-quarter revenue rose 26% year-on-year to $19.051 billion.Earnings per share for the period rose to $7.41 from $5.88 a year earlier. The data is not bad; however, stocks rose less than 1% post-market, while down 3.74% in the trading session.One would like to ask investors: friends, what do you need? To see earnings double?Who else excelled?Amid concerns that Elon Musk will have to mortgage or sell a large stake in the electric car maker to buy the social network Twitter (TWTR), Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) sank yesterday by 12.18%. As we wrote earlier, Musk raised $25.5 billion from a consortium of lenders to finance the takeover of the social network, including $12.5 billion in loans secured by part of his Tesla shares, its main asset. Another $21 billion to buy Twitter will need to be paid in cash.Another concern is that if the deal closes, Musk will be in charge of Tesla, Twitter, and aerospace company SpaceX. Will he have the time and patience to follow all the companies at once?Think for yourself: build cars, fly into space, and even guarantee freedom of speech. Genius is on the move!What will happen to the market next? Nothing special. There is a high chance that the market may \"correct\" to the level of 4300-4400 from the current levels.The fact is that the current 4100-4150 are levels of fairly strong support. Breaking them down right away is not at all easy.A breakdown of the current levels down is already a possible flight to the level of 3900. For starters. And then it is possible to see 3700-3800. To be honest, it looks too harsh so far though…Never say never. According to the present, completely no longer herbivorous, times, absolutely everything is possible.I don\\'t think it\\'s worth saying that yesterday the defensive tools increased in price even more.If I feel that the market “does not want” to break through the support, then most likely I will start selling. We will see.And yet, we must not forget: there is still a lot of liquidity on the market, there are many investors who want to purchase assets at a low price. Perhaps they will give some momentum for a rebound upwards.Everything is possible today.\\\\#reporting #markets #USA',\n",

From what I gather, as long as stock price stays above my strike price, the option can expire and all is good.

Thanks all, happy trading!1. If TSLA price goes lower than my strike price of 750, that means my 100 shares I own will get assigned and I'm paid out at $750 a share and keep the premium?2. If I wanted to avoid losing my 100 shares due to the option going ITM (below my strike price), I'd try my luck at rolling down and out and hoping the new lower strike price never hits?3. When rolling out, should I do this before my option goes ITM or while it's still OTM (getting close to going ITM)?4. If it hits expiry (6/3) does that mean I can no longer roll out?\",\n",

I feel deep down in my cockles this dip will not last a week; people will realize Twitter funding is not going to be from a selloff and Elon won\\'t abandon Tesla to focus on it. However, I\\'m actually pretty risk averse, so I\\'m maybe going to go heavy on July 15. The problem is that those option prices are too high to make it feel worth it at all. I think I\\'m going to be happy with my 10% stock quantity gain and the potential for a nice light call return and see if this dip has legs and those later option prices start falling.EDIT: Well I maxed out my margin getting those bargain barrel prices this Thursday morning. I hope this is the bottom. I went with a mix of low-cost/higher-risk calls and distant-close/costly calls. Also grabbed some more stock.If I had to guess what this dip is about, I don\\'t think it\\'s investor fear of the Twitter deal, I think very big players are trying to wipe out TSLA value to endanger Musk\\'s loan collateral for the Twitter deal. I think they\\'re spending a lot of money to do this in hopes the deal will fall through so they can make money on short positions on Twitter. If this is really happening, I am too dumb to understand how they can afford the cost of driving TSLA down; maybe they loaded up on puts before hand? They have to really be banking on the people with out-of-the-money calls that expire tomorrow to feed further retraction and for the deal to fall through before TSLA rebounds.I may have just talked myself into taking some gains today or tomorrow morning and looking for a further dip tomorrow afternoon.',\n",
       " \"Given today's massive selloff, I thought this was a good time to post this. It's a long post but hopefully it gives you context.The word on Wall Street has changed over the past year or so with regards to Tesla. You see it in the MSM’s narrative. The naysayers who used to say Tesla is going bankrupt now mostly realize this isn’t the case (GLJ research anyone?). So now the anti-TSLA narrative is a bit of the “competition is coming” (TSLA has its lowest inventory ever this year despite years of max “competition”) but even more of “it’s a great stock, but overvalued.”The natural question then is…overvalued compared to what? The Old dying OEM’s? Here’s a litany of reasoning underlying why I think a 1:1 comparison to Tesla and the other car manufacturers is silly and why Tesla deserves a far far far higher multiple compared to the dinosaurs. I tried to order them from most to least compelling, but I believe they’re all compelling. I also don’t discuss Tesla’s other businesses (FSD, software, energy, solar, robot?) because they’re somewhat speculative and I wanted to stick to the most objective measures possible.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TSLA has the highest gross automotive margins in the industry except the Ferrari’s and the Aston Martin’s of the world. This quarter’s (Q1 2022) gross automotive margins are even higher than Mercedes' margins despite more than double the volume and without the past 6 month’s car price increases being reflected yet. Its operating margin is about Triple the industry average. Why aren’t they given triple the credit per car, especially since this is a sustained, long term upward trajectory and not just an aberrant quarter? Remember, this is about trends. And the long-term trends are extremely obvious.\\\\-TSLA financials are this great despite minimal economies of scale. It is presently 10-20% the size of the old OEM’s; as Tesla’s size increases, so will operating leverage leading to even higher operating margin (ie fixed costs become a smaller and smaller portion of the total costs). While some would argue that Tesla’s average selling price (ASP) is too high to be sustainable at higher volumes (say millions of cars a year), the EV market has doubled every year in size for the past several years outpacing even Tesla’s production and thus increasing the relative demand on all EV’s. I would argue this is what is driving higher selling prices more than supply chain/material constraints. This is also seen in the secondary markets with resale value and EV’s actually appreciating after sale, especially Tesla’s.\\\\-TSLA has a number of drivers suggesting even more capital efficiency in the future thanks to things like more efficient factory layouts, more efficient build times secondary to proprietary giga casting, greater vertical integration, and increasing operating leverage from expansion. TSLA also has operational efficiency that is fairly incredible. Tesla is already able to produce many times the number of cars per year from each individual factory line compared to old OEM’s who theoretically have decades more experience with the Toyota method (see VW’s CEO openly admitting that Tesla can build cars \\\\~3x more quickly than they can). So, all other things being, equal, why doesn’t that deserve a higher multiple?\\\\-TSLA is far more efficient at investing in capital compared to just about all car manufacturers ever. As a single measure, ROIC is probably the most robust measure of a company’s financial health.. As of 2022, Volkswagen is around 4.5% for the TTM. Ford is at 4.6%. GM is 2.4%. Toyota’s at 4.35%  Tesla? It’s at 16.7% and probably growing because of expanding operating leverage. So Tesla is able to invest around 4 TIMES more efficiently and make each dollar in CAPEX stretch 4x as far as the other OEM’s. This is absurd, because unlike most of the “competition,” TSLA is growing ridiculously rapidly and somehow doesn’t have to burn huge $$$ to do it. In fact, this ridiculous capital efficiency is why they were able to have EXPAND free cash on hand despite simultaneously building two of the largest factories on earth by volume and capacity AND paying off their debts to nearly zero.\\\\-Speaking of debt, Ford, GM, VW EACH have approximately 1000 TIMES the debt that Tesla does. TSLA could have paid off it’s debt last year with a fraction of quarterly incomes as a rounding error in its statement. By contrast the old OEM’s would need a 10-20 year + of only paying off their loans to pay off their debts. Ford spends \\\\~700 million/year just paying off the INTEREST of its \\\\~150 billion in debt.  The OEM’s debt to income ratio is approximately 10 (higher is worse) and Tesla’s is approximately  0.01% . No….didn’t misplace the decimal….that is a STARK difference. Now…this comparison involves a healthy caveat…not all debt is bad debt. But the enormous difference comes down to being invested in the wrong technology and inefficient manufacturing techniques/Technology. It feels like comparing a healthy and profitable company to competitors that are very near bankruptcy by multiple objective measures.\\\\-Speaking of near bankruptcy, the old OEM’s have had year over year declining sales in volume totals for the past 5 years. Let me repeat that….5 years of declining automotive sales across all markets across almost all brands ((Toyota, GM, Ford, VW) ). Hint:  It wasn’t just the pandemic. Ford for example is down \\\\~30-40% over the past 5 years. TSLA by comparison is one of the fastest growing companies in history growing at \\\\~60% by car sales per year over the past decade. And despite sticky narratives about down quarters in isolated markets, Tesla is selling every car it makes (record low-inventory this quarter of only 12 Model S plaids company-wide) despite immense expansion. In fact, it’s world’s share of the overall OEM market has been growing consistently. And that’s all that really matters. So…doesn’t a growing and highly profitable company deserve a higher multiple compared to a slowly dying one?\\\\-TSLA has access to unlimited capital in an emergency due to its incredibly high valuation. However, because of their incredible financials, they won’t ever need to dilute stock again to raise capital seeing as how they have 20+ billion dollars on cash, expanded this despite the above CAPEX, and have an absurd ROIC for a manufacturing company. The OEM’s, on the other hand, desperately need more cash to invest many billions into making OEM’s.  \\\\-EV manufacturing has one MAJOR long-term bottleneck: the availability of Batteries. I know we’re used to chips being the limiting factor, but that’s more of an isolated this year thing related to Covid. Long-term, the world is going to need at least 20 times the batteries we have available to ramp up EV production to the point where ICE is actually a minority of cars sold. Seeing as how the OEM’s never wanted to expand EV’s (too expensive to make with too little scale, they must be sold at a loss to compete on specs, required devesting from ICE, new manufacturing headaches etc.) in the first place, obviously they never bothered to acquire long term supply contacts with battery or mineral manufacturers. Obviously Tesla has, which is why Elon is confident that for the first time ever, Tesla won’t be battery constrained this year. And…more importantly, it’s started to manufacture its own proprietary cells and chemistries in house. Only BYD does this. BYD is also the only other profitable EV manufacturer in the world….funny how that works..\\\\-TSLA has access to the very best engineering talent in the world. Survey after survey has shown that TSLA is either number 1 or 2 on the list of top places engineers want to work at after college. The best engineers drive innovation and change. None of the other OEM’s are even in the top 10 in these surveys. This is an enormous long-term differentiator whose effects will  compound each year.-TSLA is the only major EV player with its own differentiated supercharging network. People who use EV’s know what a big deal this is. Charge point and Electrify America suck and they have to accommodate every single other EV from every single other manufacturer. The latter was made by VW thanks to a fine after dieselgate and has chargers that are consistently broken and low wattage. If we are to argue that charging remains the largest sticking point for the wide-spread adoptions of EV’s,-TSLA doesn’t lose margin to dealerships and won’t need to pay dealerships to sell cars they don’t want to. You buy the car, the car comes to you and you know how much it will cost. This is big deal for those of us who hate the day of pain that dealerships cause us which is basically everyone. This is a small part of what’s driving Tesla’s incredible demand.\\\\-The Competition has paid (and will continue to pay) TSLA billions of dollars because they didn’t make a switch to EV’s fast enough. This is a negative multiple for them and a positive multiple for TSLA.Summary: I think a lot of the above differences come down to long-term vs. short term thinking by company management. Most members of a company’s board are incentivized to show short-term profits by any means over long-term sustainability. Tesla has decided to take the longest and most optimal long-term path over showing profits, which is a short term and painful gamble. Elon famously stated that if all he cared about was making profits, they could have made Tesla profitable a decade ago by just selling Roadsters. Tesla’s goal, however, is sustainable energy which famously involves “Extreme scale” and so being small and profitable was never the goal. Contrast this type of thinking to automotive CEO’s. The car manufacturing is a terrible one with horrible margins and marginally differentiated products. The barrier to entry was simply that the business model is very risky with high CAPEX and low margins resulting in really really high debt burden. This is why the overwhelming majority of all car manufacturers ever went bankrupt for a \\\\~50 year prior until Tesla came along. The OLD OEM’s made a solid bet that nobody would ever be crazy enough to step in and disrupt the status quo which worked out decently for them for decades…until it didn’t.  Now everyone seems to have forgotten how hard manufacturing 1.) At scale and 2.) profitably is because Tesla made it.As a final point, I will also say this: Objective valuation is more of an art than a science. Multiple are determined retrospectively based on prior performance of similar companies in certain market conditions. We invest and make our voices heard and the analysts take notes, NOT the other way around. It’s a subtle but incredibly important distinction. Comparative analysis  falls flat on its face when you try to shoehorn very different companies such as Tesla and the Old OEM’s into the same category without considering context. If the supported price of the stock remains arbitrarily high (and not a short-term burst like say GME) and yet valuation models aren’t questioned, than it’s the analysts who are wrong and need to change. We have seen a huge reticence for this. This is probably also due to the fact that they cover hundreds of stocks instead of a few good ones. I hope ya’ll won’t make the same mistake.Edited for formatting/spelling.\",\n",

       " \"TDLR : Are you actually such a retad you're reading this TLDR? The post is like 2 paragraphs long? No wonder this world is in shambles and Musk wants to leave to Mars after visiting Uranus. Musk has a great opportunity for Tesla's non-existent marketing.Ford, $F, spends on average, $2,000,000,000, every single year on marketing. Whether it may be sporting events, team sponsorships, videos, superbowl ads, instadumb, facialbook, titter, or even snapcock, they still spend the money and show little for it. However, after Ford is done wasting money, General Motors, $GM, steps up to hump. Just like Ford, GM spends $2,000,000,000+ every bloody year. As for returns, MINIMAL for the amount spent.(Fun Fact : $F spent actual money, making their car's infotainment screen scan roadside ads instead of making better cars. no joke)Now we move on to Tesla. And if you somehow don't know what I'm about to say, computers at your local library are good for more than porn. Use them to fact check and research you twats. Tesla, $TSLA, spends $0 for marketing every single year. They rely on other peoples passion and social media for marketing. Similar to Starbucks, and with the same waterfall effect. The most trending car on the planet is LITERALLY just like the most trending coffee on the planet(costa fans stfu). With Musk purchasing Titter with his own funding, he could, in theory, use the platform as a marketing outlet for Tesla without adding a marketing budget.Thoughts?PS : I am a fucking chicken. I do not want any awards, but simply videos sent to me of fellow chickens making sweet passionate love. Have a friendly conversation down below. CreamyChickenCock out.Edit : spelling but I can't use auto correct so how tf am I supposed to know what is mispelt? FUCK YOU REDDIT\",\n",

       " 'Note the inflection in wait times for Model 3 in Germany. Analysts believe this reflects the impact of the COVID-related closure at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, which manufactures Model 3 for the European market. This data series will be useful for investors who are attempting to assess the achievability of Tesla’s full-year production target (+60% y/y). If wait times remain elevated in Germany – or if they eventually inflect higher in China – it will imply continued production headaches and possible downside vs. the full-year target. Such “tactical” information does little to inform overall thesis, but investors should be aware of the potential for attractive entry-points if guidance is reduced due to persistent challenges in China.[',\n",
       " \"So Im new to getting into big time stocks or more expensive stocks, however, a current theme I am seeing is that Tesla is the one (or one of) to get into. It shows future promise from what i can tell as electric is being pushed for more and more.  Some of their tech is being used elsewhere and Ive also been seeing a lot of talk about a 20 to 1 split. That being said, the last split was 5 to 1, I think. And the stock bounced back and what, doubled? Its 1k a share right now and that is kind of daunting for me to think about, but the potential seems like it's there to for sure break even or make some extra. I chickened out at 86 bucks a share a while back and now look at me. 1000 the. Would be 10-11k now. Im just curious what everyones thoughts are? Concerns? It has a Buy rating last I checked. But again, I could be thinking about this allllllllll wrong and just be out a grand for nothing. Thanks and goodluck to everyone on your trades.\",\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone, we are finally back near 13,000. I was telling my team again yesterday. I am not a Debbie downer. By nature I am a bull, however I have traded so long I do not ignore the data. I also am very used to trading on facts. What have you done? What are you doing now? What is your forecast within the next year \\\\[Only creditable if you have delivered in the past, if not, the Ceo/Company forecast is worthless!\\\\] Trust me, once you have traded 10 years you will side with me and get tired of fake stories and fake promises by Ceos, companies, analysts. No company comes public and says, hey, my company isn’t to good right now, we don’t have any sales, and we do not know when we will be profitable, that Ceo would be fired. So everything that is said, you have to take a look at the history, what the company has done, and what is the likelihood that the promises are realistic. GPS lowers guidance….CRSR lowers guidance again! The CEO had said before that this was a 1 time only previously… This may give a glimpse on NVDA and AMD. CRSR makes gaming products, video cards, motherboards. This time last year they were swimming in money. Slamming sales and bottom line… but this is why we must re evaluate each quarter after earnings…. Ok the company beat last quarter top and bottom… by how much? What were the margins? What is the likelihood again?... if the company missed you can get an idea if it’s a 1 time only or may be a while for a turn around. I lost confidence in CRSR many months ago, it was around 30-32, but I had to take it off plays once earnings results were taking a hit…. That is because once earnings takes a hit, I would say 75% of the time it is not a 1 time deal and it follows this trend……….So last quarter earnings over all I would have to say we were in a 65-70 grading scale over all, check yourself. That is, most companies were in line on both sales and earnings… if they beat it was by less than 3% on 1 of the other not on both! I have a post a video on my grading it is your money! That was a sign that earnings were coming down and will probably get worse before it gets better. Check yourself right now I would say earnings so far are 60-65. That is most companies are missing the top or the bottom, but not both… most! If you just meet top and bottom it is a 65! Passing! It doesn’t mean wow, good or great earnings. It was a laugher to me that people said IBM earnings were great 2 days ago. That was not great, it was maybe an 80. Which is good, but not great. They beat both by like 5%.... Want to see great today? Check CLF? However we are not getting to many great reports and most are either meeting top and bottom or missing 1 or the other. Compare this to 1st quarter of 2021 when we rallied, 2nd quarter.. I would say the average company was getting 75-80 and most were 90+! That is most companies were beating top and bottom by 10% now that’s great!If your company is suppose to have 1 billion in sales and make 1 dollar. It comes in at 1.1 billion sales and 1.10 bottom line, that is great 10% beat on both!On March 20th 2022, I made a video. I said this rally was fake. The fed raised rates on 3/16. They even forecast that inflation was getting out of hand and they would be very aggressive. THEY SAID THIS! Did the market listen? Absolutely not! When I made this video the Nasdaq had rallied from 3/16 a Wednesday, to Friday 3/19 near 14,000! This is from 12,500 to 14,000. Naturally, when I heard the news, and saw all the data it was horrible. Not bad, horrible. So what did I do? I kept going with my plan which was working like a charm. 80% puts and 20% calls. I changed up my strategy a little because of a mistake I made late January. We all make mistakes it is what we learn from them. In late January I opened like 15 puts in 1 day. Then the very next day I opened up 15 puts and I was stuck for a while, because I do not double down or gamble…. So this time around late March I opened 4-5 puts a day for 4 days… The market rallied from 12,500 to 14,800 in 3 weeks! With no major red days. I was sitting on about 20 puts.. My problem was and now I am tweaking the strategy is that almost all my puts was expiring 4/14… Now I will buy no more than 5 calls or puts in 1 day \\\\[unless I close a trade\\\\] and I will have no more than 5 options expiring the same day…. I had 12 puts expire Thursday 4/14 which every single put except PANW would be in the money 1 week later!!! What does that mean? It means I was very accurate with my plays but I was not accurate with the timing… Why wasn’t I accurate with the timing? Because despite the horrible data, the market which is infused with retail was not very bright and bid to rally the market. Let them get hurt as we are near 13,000 because if they don’t wake up, pivot they will keep trading to lose everything… Can you scalp, trade to win in a bear market.. yes, definitely…. But what is the probability that you sold MULN 3+, HYMC 3+, ATER 7+, SST 30+… Trading in the market for me is very long term. I will trade for another 30+ years. I started in 1994 on my 14th birthday. This is not the recipe for long term. Can it be done, possibly….. It is more likely in a bull market that you will be more successful because we are green everyday and there is no fear…. Other retail will rally with you together without fear.. That doesn’t happen as easily when everything else is falling.2 days ago CVNA had awful earnings. Actually far worse than NFLX. They lost a ton of money. When a company loses a ton of money, what do they do? Raise cash! Because of this and because they can wash out demand by printing brand new shares for free into retail the game of the stock market will never change. You can try and fight me all you want. I can tell see offerings from companies daily! Daily! A lot of these companies get pushed up by apes, only to get washed away by the company that has infinite power to dilute you and for free… So, you can not bid up disasters because as you and your friends form a little army and push 100k shares… the following week the company dumps 500K brand new shares on you! That is not changing!! NEVER!! What can retail do? I will make a video, but I have made videos on it. If retail would wake up and go into the right companies they could keep it going without be washed out….. Will they probably not! Why? I am trading companies that have beat earnings over and over again. They have buy backs \\\\[which cut supply of shares, increase demand from the company itself\\\\] and do retail follow? No!! You tell me a company, any company where retail made it a MEME that was doing this? The only solid companies that I have seen retail meme was RKT and BGFV, and they got out quickly!The past week I been trading ONEW and LOVE. Yesterday, I traded LOVE 3 rounds and have shares at 49.75. Check out their last 4 earnings, financials. This is a 15x PE ratio with amazing growth that has beat over and over again. ONEW is 5x PE that has done the same. They make money, you don’t see heavy volume in these because they aren’t popular. However these were much higher and the company didn’t dump shares, insiders didn’t abandon ship… How about TSLA form 4? I tell you do not check insider sales on TSLA you will throw up!5 Trade ideas:DDOG – Still a high flier this data analytics company is still sky high but I will get puts if it is positiveKMX – Carmax, they make money, I did trade this a few times, it is near a 52 week low, the earnings were ok, not good not bad, but I may get calls if 87-88MELI – Man this South America Amazon fell near 100 yesterday. I did have puts that expired last week, the stock was 1,150 and I needed 1000. If this rallies today. Puts!QCOM – This 5G chip maker when this is 133-135 I have been getting calls a 17x PE and 15% growth they make money and have been beatingSNAP – They missed top and bottom. I have 0 faith in the CEO and 2 quarters ago that earnings was not good an over reaction to mediocre earnings the company followed up immediately with convertible bonds, check google not fud!

       " \"Have you invested in Tesla stock? Today its market value has exceeded $1 trillion. How did Tesla grow into a $1 trillion public company? Let's look at its acquisitions.Tesla was founded in 2003, with a revenue of $53.823 billion in 2021 and a market value of $1.08 trillion. Tesla is still a relatively young company, but it has quickly grown into the most valuable automaker, backed by a series of key acquisitions. The main purpose of these acquisitions is to increase manufacturing capacity, increase the speed and efficiency of operations, and reduce costs.Below, we'll take a closer look at 5 of Tesla's most important acquisitions.  1. Sun City Company\\uf0b7 Type of business: Solar\\uf0b7 Acquisition price: $2.1 billion\\uf0b7 Date of acquisition: November 21, 2016SolarCity was founded in 2006 by two cousins \\u200b\\u200bof Elon Musk. The idea for the company was that of Musk, who also provided initial working capital and served as chairman. SolarCity designs, manufactures and installs solar energy systems and sells solar power. In August 2016, Tesla announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire SolarCity, with the merger closing later that year. Tesla said the merger would create the world's first vertically integrated sustainable energy company, leveraging the synergies created by combining Tesla's energy storage with SolarCity's solar power. Although the merger was approved by a majority of Tesla shareholders, some Tesla investors later sued the company. They claim that the real motive for the deal was to bail out SolarCity, which was struggling financially at the time.2. Maxwell Technologies\\uf0b7 Type of business: energy storage and power transmission products\\uf0b7 Acquisition price: $207 million\\uf0b7 Acquisition date: May 16, 2019The company was founded in 1965 as Maxwell Laboratories Inc. It went public in 1983 and then changed its name to Maxwell Technologies Inc in 1996. The manufacturer of energy storage and power delivery solutions specializes in ultracapacitors, devices capable of holding more energy than standard capacitors. Its products are used in a range of applications including transportation, industrial and grid energy storage. In May 2019, Maxwell was acquired by Tesla. Musk has said in the past that supercapacitors will be a breakthrough in electric vehicle production. He is also optimistic about Maxwell's efficient process for producing battery components, which could drastically reduce the cost of Tesla's electric vehicles.3. Groman Engineering Co., Ltd.\\uf0b7 Type of business: automated manufacturing systems\\uf0b7 Acquisition price: $135.3 million\\uf0b7 Acquisition date: January 3, 2017Germany-based Grohmann Engineering was founded in 1963 by Klaus Grohmann. The company specializes in the design and development of automated manufacturing systems. When Tesla announced its acquisition of Grohmann in November 2016, the company had 700 employees and had grown revenue at an average annual rate of 6% over the past 20 years. Tesla completed the acquisition in January 2017 for $135.3 million. This total cost includes an initial cash payment of $109.5 million and an additional $25.8 million paid in the first quarter of 2020 as part of an incentive compensation arrangement. Tesla said the acquisition will help the electric car maker increase the speed and efficiency of its manufacturing process, which will significantly reduce expenses.4. Perbix Machinery Co., Ltd.\\uf0b7 Type of business: automated manufacturing equipment\\uf0b7 Acquisition Price: Financial terms not disclosed; estimated value of $10.5 million.\\uf0b7 Acquisition date: November 7, 2017Founded in 1976, Perbix specializes in the design and manufacture of custom, highly automated manufacturing equipment. It was acquired by Tesla in 2017. Earlier in 2017, Tesla acquired Grohmann Engineering, a German company doing a similar business. The acquisition of Perbix gives Tesla more control over vehicle production by making more auto parts in-house. The acquisition is another step in Tesla's push to optimize and accelerate its electric vehicle production process, following the acquisition of Grohmann.5. Haiba System Co., Ltd.\\uf0b7 Type of business: Manufacturer of automated liquid dispensing and filling systems\\uf0b7 Acquisition price: Financial terms not disclosed\\uf0b7 Date of acquisition: 2019Canada-based Hibar Systems was founded in 1974. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of high-precision dispensing pumps and filling systems, including automatic vacuum filling systems for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. The exact timing of the acquisition is unclear, as Tesla did not announce the acquisition. But in October 2019, Tesla listed Hibar as one of its subsidiaries in an Oct. 2 filing with the Canadian government, according to several publications in the U.S. and Canada. Tesla's interest in the company is more explicit. Hibar will allow the electric car maker to produce batteries in-house. The move will help reduce key operating expenses with which Tesla co-owns and operates a battery factory in Nevada.This is part of what makes Tesla a great company. They know their shortcomings and quickly acquire excellent companies in related industries to make up for their shortcomings. In the end, the behemoth achieved its own market value of $1 trillion, and it is still growing.The just-announced Q1 financial report reached an explosive growth of $18.7 billion. In the future, we believe that Tesla will get better and better.What do you think?\",\n",

       " 'The strong FCF generated is hard to ignore, and the power of Tesla’s model is coming through. While legacy OEMs may view this as a target for how profitable EVs can be, analysts believe it could be years (if ever) before they reach the margins Tesla currently enjoys on their vehicles. TSLA’s profits allows them to invest in robotaxis (Elon stated volume production in 2024, though we’d fade) and Optimus (Elon believes market missing and will be more valuable than car business, he’s in past said same thing about Energy).Higher ASPs helped 1Q22 revenue and GM and recent price increases not in results yet because those are for, in some cases, deliveries in 6-12 months. Price increases reflect anticipated supplier and logistic inflation, and also taking advantage of near-term supply/demand imbalance. Encouragingly, higher prices don’t seem to be impacting demand. Despite inflation, TSLA indicated COGS/vehicle lower due to higher mix of Shanghai made vehicles, lower expedited logistics and Fremont productivity. Longterm contracts keeping costs down for now, but those eventually run out. Right now, TSLA sees biggest challenges with lithium but stressed cathode flexibility (nickel vs. LFP) is critical (\\\\~1/2 of 1Q22 Tesla units were LFP).Analysts believe behind initial 4680 goals and indicated will take a few years to achieve initial timeline. For instance, Austin building Model Ys with 4680 but will also build with 2170 cells(risk mitigation cited). Elon did indicate 4680 as a structural pack will be competitive with best alternatives later this year and exceed them next. Interestingly, because the semi shortage limited vehicle production, TSLA has sizable cell inventory to support 2022 volume targets while allowing them to be “deliberate” with 4680 ramp.[',\n",

       " 'Good morning everyone. I firstly want everyone to know that I am more of an analyst that seeks an opportunity and exploits it. Of course I am a trader but if I had to narrow down the type of trader I am, that is more or less how I view myself. As an analyst before I make trades, I have a fair value for each company I choose to trade. Just because a fair value for ATER is $1, BBIG is $1 and MULN is 50 cents does not mean I am willing to take the trade. I will tell you all that GME fair value after that report may not be $10 a share of 800 million and same goes for AMC. That does not mean I think you should short or buy puts… Why? Perception, someone for whatever reason sees value in these companies. They either or buying it for a trade or perceive that something will change so much that these are 10-15 billion dollar companies…. RAD got a cash buyout of 815 million, they had 24 billon in sales in 2021. They have said EBIDTA will be 460-500 million for this year. \\\\[That is outside of tax, depreciation and interest they will make 460-500 million! Last year they have + cash flow of near 400 million and paid down 212 million debt\\\\]. Buy out 815 million! ATER was a company valued at nearly 5 billion at its peak with no sales and losing money. I do not even have to talk about GME and AMC. All they do is lose cash and sell shares to make cash… Don’t believe me google offerings…. That said, I wrote a large paragraph yesterday about TSLA. If we trade in reality not a dream… TSLA arguable has a bigger cult than AMC/GME, that said the chances of it dropping to fair value now of 300 is probably not. NFLX had a cult, then had 2 bad reports in a row, the cult is shattered fear and now has dumped…… When AMC was 12 and GME was under 80 I did figure many of their cults were shattered and indeed I am shocked they started going again, that said as you know I am not known enough to control billion dollar companies….. I have wrote many months ago that AMZN fair value was between 1,700-1,800, this is based on actual figures… I am old school, I do not trade on hope. The way I look at TSLA is this, it is growing at 50-75% which does indeed mean it should get a premium, the margins are higher…. You should note the financials got worse this past quarter, 17 billion cash and 21 billion short term liabilities \\\\[Debt due within a year\\\\]. It doesn’t mean they are going out of business, but it means the likelihood of them selling shares within a year are high because they must generate 4+ billion cash flow without adding onto debt! That is a knock on my multiple. TSLA yesterday had the most artificially pumped report in 4+ quarters. WHY? Please check their 8K. All I can see are the last 4 quarters. Q1 2021 518, Q2 2021 354, Q3 2021 279, Q4 2021 314, and finally 679! These numbers add onto sales and because there is no cost on a balance sheet they are 100% profit and inflate bottom line by the same number… I do not expect you to know this, I don’t expect analysts to know this. I know this because I have followed the company over 10+ years… Why you cant control reg credits, as I wrote yesterday this will go away 100% eventually. In 2023 I expect most manufacturers to have some EVs and they will not need to buy credits from TSLA to avoid being penalized by Uncle Sam. I do not see that in 2022 but by 2023 most will, not all, most. I think by 2024-2025 100% they will have 0! 0 artificially inflated credit sales. They have billions, billions in artificial pump, maybe even 10 billion! I don’t care enough to check their history but you should all know. You can fool the world but you aren’t fooling me. EPS was 2.50 and sales was 18 billion without these credits. Why do I take these out? If you make 5,000 a month from your job but your mom gives you 1,000 a month for aid but tells you next year she isn’t helping, you do not tell people you make 6,000 a month. Get real! Technically you can, but get real. The report was good but not great, Id say give it a 75…. If you want to see great earnings check DQ and POOL. DQ I cant touch because it is Chinese. They made 6.99 per share for the last quarter…. TSLA 2.50! Check POOL, POOL has been beating top and bottom line… TPH report was good, but with rates rising they are killing home builders. BZH guidance was for 5 dollars a share. The stock is 15! They beat on top and bottom last quarter…… TSLA will make about 7-8 dollars. In a bear market I would give it a 40-50x multiple which is about 300…… When I trade I, I trade in reality, if I do not agree with a stock price I just stay away…. In regard to TSLA if 1,100 I want puts! So please pump it.Daily views on the Daily Plays gets between 3,000 to 5,000 views daily. I do not think that is high, then again I do not advertise, I don’t use Reddit much, but keep in mind the sub only has 6,800. That said, I was being attacked yesterday, which is fine, I am a grown up. I like to have debates when it makes sense. I have debated with many on my Elite team. When the market doesn’t react like it should, this is money, we are all going to be rattled and that is fine.. However, I do like to have a debate based on facts, reasons why…. and not because speculation and momentum. I have said it before I will say it again. The stock and the company are 2 different things. GME AMC TSLA ATER sentiment is very strong, you can use charts and see the buying over riding sellers…. However in a bear market to go long on speculation without facts will not work in the long run… If you are making money, as I wrote yesterday, keep making it. Do your thing. This is not a competition. This is not a race, we are all on different journeys. I do not treat the guy that is trying to make 1,000 a week differently from the guy trying to make 5,000. I was a millionaire at 25 from trading. I started buying properties at 35k, to diversify my portfolio. I am currently trying to buy up to 2 million in properties. I made an offer with a contract yesterday. I am putting 25% down these are investment properties. I do not know for sure if I am spending 500K \\\\[25% down\\\\] everything is going over asking!! However I will buy at least 1 million, because I want to buy something before rates go insane. I am overpaying now and I am fine with it because \\\\[I do not have a W2 anymore as I retired last November, banks hate that, rates may not come down for a year, and demand is very strong, strong enough where prices wont settle\\\\] I have shown my W2 and pay stubs to many on my Elite team. Wage was 148 in 2021 and take home was near 80. NYC, single, not married no kids, I am robbed. Between federal, state and city taxes they take out nearly 50%!! I never read a Robert Kiyosaki book until about a month ago, I swear, but he goes into this in detail why the real rich do not get there with a W2. For me, I started a W2 in 2012 for reasons I wrote around the war, that I do not want to repeat and I need a W2/Pay stubs for my properties… I am in luck the bank hasn’t asked me for Pay stubs as I am making offers… I started making offers in January and I was able to produce my late November pay stubs, so I am lucky. They havent even asked for 2021 taxes, which my accountant filed an extension, my taxes are very complicated… This is not an Ego boost, trust me I was in the shadows from 2000 to 2021 January, this is to tell you I am on a different journey, we all are. I am not saying I am better than anyone, or any of you. I do not single out and attack anyone. I do indeed attack stocks. A few months ago I was slamming RBLX 140+, DKNG 30+ all I got was angry people. So angry I was reported to Reddit… and to be honest when I got that, I had and I still have a different feeling. I lost a lot of motivation because of a few bad apples. I was sharing every weeks my IBKR account that started with 6,000. It got as high as 9,500 and it is 7,000 now, because of puts that expired 4/14…Don’t be that bad apple that ruins things for others. I do not ban or mute anyone. I allow anyone to express themselves, even if its an attack on me. Anyone can post. I spend 60-90 minutes a day on the daily plays. These are my thoughts and my strategy going into the day. My goal is different than yours, this is not a competition. So if you feel the need to attack me, you are just making it worse for everyone else. I will tell you whoever reported me or few that did in January changed this sub greatly. I am sure I would have done much more for this sub….I used to get 50-100 messages a day, and not just from my team, I get 10-20… I have distanced myself from the average redditor, I do not answer every message now, because I was reported in January. So please don’t be selfish… Instead if you feel you are great, your group is great. You make posts! Daily Plays is not just limited to me… in case someone else wanted to use it or in case I wanted to take a break…. I actually would not be opposed if someone else wanted to give it a shot….however if it gets a lot of negatives and comments are to take it down, I WOULD! That said, if it comes to a point where comments are telling me I am delusional and no one likes my Daily Plays, I will stop as well. At the moment it is read 3,000-5,000 a day. So if you do not benefit from my daily plays do not assume the next person does not.Man, for less than 5 mins RAD hit 10+. I do not always put in limit orders unfortunately. Around 3:15 the NY post leaked that RAD got an offer for 14.60. RAD confirmed this morning. I have 2,000 shares at 8.30. No calls at the moment. I watched RAD about 3:25 but in those 10 mins it dropped under 9! I did immediately put a 9 sale.. and hoped it would bounce… Around 3:35 it dipped under 8.50…. and I dropped my sell to 8.75.. which it did not hit… My hopes are that I can trade it for 15-50 cents and keep trading it. I did not do this yesterday because of Greed. I saw a 14.60 buyout and figured WTF I cant get 9??? I kept lowering it…. 8.95…. 8.90…8.85 and finally 8.75… Hindsight is always 20/20. I am happy Sparky caught it. 2 of my generals caught it at 9.50 up… I was talking with my banker because I just finished making an offer on a 3 family in New Hartford CT. I did buy NFLX calls when the stock was around 230. It was definitely oversold but it is hard to time the perfect bottom. I have 6/17 280 strike for 5.50….. It is under pressure because late last night Ackman revealed he sold his 3+ million shares for a 400 million loss. His average was near 375. People will lose confidence, but more than likely he sold at the open when the stock was 240+ and at least we don’t have his selling pressure. NFLX is now under 100 billion and does make money.. There is concern decline in sales and earnings but I like the risk reward of options. I am not a gambler so I do not double down, I am ok, I have about 2,500 in this bet.5 Trade ideas:CVNA – Wow earnings were really bad, really bad! Worse than NFLX. Please 95+ at first it crashed to 72 and went to 100 after hours… Are people serious? They are printing 1 billion in shares. Please 95+….. mind you my 4/14 95 strike puts expired last week! Yes, I am mad. This buy a car online and deliver it to you has had 2 straight horrible quarters. I was buying puts at 200+ if you check daily plays from months agoENDP – Tremendous news about 6PM last night. The state of Tenn. there was a judge who tried to overturn a settle which was for 35 million several months ago and put on deeper sanctions. The stock crumbled about a month ago when this first happened. They also settled with the State of Alabama yesterday and the city of San Francisco…. I have 4,000 shares at 4… I may buy calls. Let us seeFLWS – Mothers day is coming. This was 13 the other day, I may buy shares and calls, last earnings was bad, this isn’t an earnings play this is a mothers day trade, I may wait for earnings on the shares but may buy the calls if it dips to 13.

       " 'Good morning everyone. You will see on this post in 1/27/2022 even before this earnings report I had already said that NFLX was worth about 180. [ the first time in 10 years NFLX lost subs. They were expected to add 2+ million subs and lost 200k. In actuality the numbers were slightly off, they beat bottom line and missed top line, however the problem is they also forecast 2nd qtr to lose 2 million subs or more…You have to ask yourself does this mean that instead of growth they will have a decrease in sales and earnings. When the market opens this will have near a 25-30x PE….. I like using PE ratio, it is not the only number but it is the quickest way to get an idea of what a stock price is relative to earnings power. For me, it is the #1 most important figure. In a bull run, I may trade stocks with no PE ratio, companies that lose money…however in a bear market I will trade stocks with under 20 PE ratio. Remember, historically the SP500 trades near 20x earnings. In 2021 it got as high as 30+. It is near 20 again after the fall, because these are considered the best 500 companies and on average they trade 20x earnings and grow near 10% sales year over year EPS 5%, you should reflect that in the stocks that you trade. Does your stock even make money? If they do, what is their growth? Earnings? If they wont make money for 18 months I do not even bother, it is a grenade! Can you make money trading it still, of course…. Check the disaster company ATER the past 2 weeks from 2 to 7+, however your recipe is hope the next guy bids it higher. Long term that is not the strategy to be successful. Now in 2021 there were some traders on Reddit who did well and retired, according to them, if your plan is to make it big and set off into the sunset you are fine……however if you want to do this for 10-20-30 years you have to look yourself in the mirror and really ask yourself if this is working…If you have been scalping grenades and keep making money, hey I cant blame you, keep doing it, don’t listen to anyone if you are making money no matter what market this is, I have traded nearly 30 years before I was able to drive, before I was able to get a permit and if this is working for a 1-2 years ask yourself if it should work 10+…..I had quite a few messages on ATER, what to do…It is a grenade the company is trash, their fundamentals are absolutely atrocious, trade it at your own risk, it has retail love as it did when it flew from 3 to 18…. NFLX for well over a year had retail love and flew to 700+, they had a 150X pe, because it wasn’t earning as much back then…..now it has come to reality… You may think NFLX is cheap now, but they will earn 8-10 dollars per share… What happens if they earn 6-8 a share and 25x PE.. then it is near 150! Be careful of reality if you are in a stock with no PE or an insane PE ratio…. If you are trading knowing the risk, at least mitigate the risk and don’t go all in at 1 price……TSLA has a PE ratio of near 300x and have sales far lower then the #1 market leader TM. TM sells near 10 million cars a year. TSLA had a record 936K cars sold in 2021. TM has a PE ratio of 9! It pays a dividend and they sell and earn way more than TSLA. TM is worth 235 billion as of this morning. TSLA is worth 1.1 Trillion. TSLA is worth more than the top 20 car companies combined. Not a typo and not fud either. They sell together maybe 35 million cars a year and TSLA is worth more than them all… Does that sound crazy? Yeah? Because it is. TSLA for many years has padded their bottom line with the sale of regulatory credits, billions! Other companies buy credits from TSLA to avoid fines from the government for EV.. In 2023 most manufacturers will have an EV and will no longer be buying coupons from TSLA \\\\[padding their earnings\\\\] Without these credits TSLA does not even make 10 dollars a share but it is trading at 1,030… What if reality hits? Can TLSA be worth 1,000, one day? Maybe…. I wouldn’t say no, but that is when it makes 30 dollars a share, giving it a 33+ PE. When will that be? We have to see if the company executes…. Cathie Wood is delusional 4,600 by 2026? Even at a 50x Pe ratio \\\\[And a company should be growing sales at 75% or more, to me for a 50x PE\\\\] at 4,600 that means TSLA will have to make 92 dollars a share… At 4,600 that means the company is worth near 5 trillion, almost double a cash cow AAPL… delusional… the data/numbers do not add up… I do see TSLA making 30 a share but maybe in a few years! That is when it is actually worth 1,000…. As we see a stock and a company are 2 different things, for over a year NFLX was inflated and is coming back to reality.. in time, every company 100% comes to reality. I am not saying 95 or 99% of companies. I am saying 100%. I have never seen a company trade in a dream forever…That is because, like my video says, the market will never, ever, ever change! When a company loses money they will sell shares increasing supply, when they make money they can buy shares increasing demand and decreasing supply…. Am I shocked that AMC and GME has gone on for over 14 months…. 100% but as I said in a video, retail must lose money for the market to make a little more sense again. Why? Not everything can go up at the same time. If you keep buying ATER, BBIG, AMC, GME you are taking money away from ONEW \\\\[5x PE\\\\], TX and ZEUS \\\\[4-5x PE\\\\], ZIM \\\\[3X\\\\]… Stocks like IVR, NYMT that pay dividends have a PE ratio of under 10 and dividend of over 10%... which does not make sense… it does not make sense because the market is acting irrational. It is acting irrational because the market has never had this much retail before. Retail doesn’t know what they are doing. I watched SST ride from 12 to 37 on the back of retail and now its 13.50 in under 2 weeks…. Why? The original people bidding at the auction do not want to pay more, what has fundamentally changed? It is not necessary for a stock to have massive volume to fall from 150 to 10 in 1 day… No, I don’t think it will happen but it isn’t necessary. If your stock trades at 150 and the next day the lowest bid is 10… Guess what? There wasn’t much volume overnight but now its 10!! NFLX crashed right away to 260 because that was the bid! So be careful in what you buy, do not let FOMO factor in every decision. If you decide to throw a grenade just know the risk. I do not mind so much, when someone says, well I put 1,000 into SST because I wanted to make 1,000 right away…. I hate when someone says, I put 1,000 because I was told it was going to double. I believe what I was told, I read the DD, it was impossible for me to lose money, I was blindsided. Don’t be blindsided! At least 10 people asked me about MULN. I had the same response. Trade it, make money, but throw this grenade at your own risk. They were all pretty upset, a few even told me how it’s a great company and how they will dominate… MY FRIENDS I have traded since 1994, I have heard the games thrown by retail, TV analysts and even CEOs. This is a 500 million dollar company that doesn’t make money! Can they? Sure… but I rather buy it when its proven… Can you make money trading it? 100% but trade it at your own risk. I will throw some grenades on the next bull run but not now.Trust me, I made these mistakes too! But I learned from them. When I lost 25K on HMNY \\\\[owner of Moviepass\\\\] in 2017/2018, it definitely sucked but I knew I was buying a grenade and had hoped they would find a way to monetize their 4 million members. They went from 10K members to 4 million in a few months… In 2020 I lost 32,50 on TRLD, Men’s Warehouse, I knew with Covid things would be hard but I did not think they would run out of cash. And they ran out of cash 3rd quarter of 2020.. This was before 2021 when bankrupt companies unloaded shares to get much needed cash… EXPR is not even close to what TLRD was, but it they lived to 2021 and unloaded shares on retail. In the 90s I made many of these mistakes, not a couple, not a few, not several… MANY! But I learned from the mistakes… I was like much of retail… I did no want to believe it can happen. I did not want to look at the fundamentals. In 1994, when I started all I traded was blue chips… The Nasdaq took off from 1997-2000 and the luster of the quick buck, I started throwing all grenades…..Moral is if things come to reality be careful!When NFLX was 700 no one would have believed it was possible to see 250…… I tell people that TSLA is worth 300 and its 1050 people laugh…….. By the way TSLA is not worth 300 because of their tech or car company… They are only worth 300 because of the stock company! They can unload shares on retail when cash is needed! Do you see MULN, do you see SST? They don’t have the lovers/cult that backed them like NFLX and TSLA. They came to reality way faster…. TSLA was meme # 1, it was short 15-20% This was a 60-70 billion dollar company January 1st of 2020… What have they fundamentally done to make it worth 1.1 trillion? It may be worth more than 60-70 billion… they have started to earn money… but mainly #1 they were able to sell shares for much needed cash to keep the business flowing… and that works but only for so long before the rug pull…… I do think like I said 1 day TSLA will have the power to make 30 dollars a share and be worth 1,000… but definitely not now!! Not maybe… DEFINITELY! I am not delusional like Cathie Wood.I been trading ONEW daily but didn’t trade it this week. They have been beating and buying competitors, on Monday it dropped to 30.80.. I cant lie I was in shell shock because of my puts expiring Thursday 4/14…..I have UPST calls, I am up fairly nice, it is up again premarket. I have been trading UBER shares because they destroyed on sales and made a profit! When they were expected to lose. I have shares at 35.10… I did not make a trade Monday or Tuesday. This is not a competition, we are each on our own journeys. Do not feel like you must trade because you see others. ..But do check winning trades and try and see the thought process, why?5 Trade ideas:AMZN – I was bidding on puts for hours and get didn’t get filled, futures are up so I will be able to buy puts with the stock higherBA – A disaster financially, it was up nice, please 190+, please for putsFRPT – Fresh pet food, this has been a put fave because numbers do not match the stock, please rally for putsNFLX – This is a trade only!

       " 'Tesla is sitting over $1,000 today after bouncing back (again) from around $800. Our favorite fund manager, Cathie Wood, and the team at ARK smoke the $4,600 a share hopium as soon as they wake up in the morning. If they’re right (and they always, always are) then we’re looking at 450% return on the stock over the next several years. That’s great, but I don’t have the dry powder to buy enough stock to change lives. Here are my reasons why I really, truly do believe this company is going even higher: and they aren’t what you expect. 1: I genuinely feel for Elon as a human being. If you care to watch him closely in moments of contemplation, he isn’t all 420 jokes and dog memes. This is a man who is badly scarred from childhood, still struggling to fix the world around him like he could never do for himself. This is the type of deep, foundational pain that most people don’t understand but, for those of us who do, explains so much about how driven to obsessive he is. This is a man who is going to literally change the course of human history because he can’t change his own. 2: Tesla isn’t a car company. The things that excite me about the next 3-5 years have nothing to do with that sexy, sexy S Plaid. I’m talking robots. I’m talking battery technology, capacity, and vertical integration. I’m talking about AI that goes beyond autonomous vehicles. I’m talking about Optimus. Come on! The name is literally Optimus!3: Scale. Elon is all about scale. More, faster, better, and cheaper as they grow. Even while raw materials shoot through the roof, they’re acquiring the whole chain. They’re making everything they can in house or own the suppliers. That type of scalability is literally unheard. So I’m in. I’m all in. I’m going to sell my crap stocks like <insert everything> and buy up whatever I can. However, I just bought a home and my kid is about to go to a stupidly, ridiculously expensive college. I foolishly sold 35 shares to help buy shelter so I’m down to just 15. Picking up a few shares now and then when it dips isn’t going to cut it for me. So this has got to be some crazy option play.

I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122.

       " 'Good morning everyone. The market has a big rally yesterday. The PPI \\\\[Producer Price Index\\\\] yesterday morning was bad. The market should not have rallied. This morning so far we have had several reports. GS \\\\[Which I own since 2008\\\\] had a great report, C, MS slight beat I would say they get a 70-75 and GS an 80-85. UNH a 70. WFC PNC and RAD missed on either top or bottom and as I wrote yesterday if you miss on 1 of 2 numbers you can not get above a 60 because there are just 2 numbers! You cant pass by beating 1! I will have to look at RAD report later on in the evening an unbiased opinion with the SEC filing. On surface to me, it was more bad than good. I would even say it is a 55-60 and not a strong 60. They beat top line \\\\[Sales\\\\] by near 10% but missed on bottom line by a mile! Not as bad as BBBY but bad! On the article it is impairment charges \\\\[Value of assets\\\\] closing of stores, but I want to see what was submitted to the SEC…. What was good was guidance was above estimates on both sales and bottom line. I wouldn’t say far above, but above. What was good is they announced EBIDTA to be 460-500 million positive for the year… that is before taxes, depreciation and options/compensation… Remember RAD has 3+ billion in debt and does pay close to 30 million a month. They did pay over 200 million from their cash flows to overall debt for last year.Elon musk offers 54.20 or near 45 billion in cash for TWTR? What cash? He would have to get a loan, or sell more TSLA shares. He is so happy TSLA was meme #1 before GME and AMC. January of 2020 pre pandemic, the stock was 82, check, no fud here….That was presplit! Now, with GAMMA and Short squeeze it is 5,250! TSLA used to be short 10-15%!! …… At that time Musk was worth near 10 billion dollars! TSLA was worth near 50 billion. NOT FUD! What is the point? Did you see my video on stock used as a currency? Do you see what retail and the market has given Musk insiders by shooting up his currency? He is offering in cash, what TSLA was worth as a company pre pandemic….. What cash? He will either use his shares as collateral or dump shares…. What Musk dumped and sold already in late December 2021 was more than he was worth on January 1st of 2020!! Facts not fud!!!So, the market will never ever change.. As I did a video, the people that own the most shares \\\\[or can print endless supply of shares\\\\] or a very concentrated group of people/company. The retail that owns TSLA? I don’t know, this is a guess, they have 1.1 billion shares, let us say they have 25 million different owners………Musk himself owns near 18% of TSLA.. A small group own 70% of TSLA…. So retail if the diamond hands hold, don’t trade, rocket up the stock, so that small group of 25-50 people can sell off slowly to retail… Facts… Until the SEC makes rule changes saying insiders cant sell, a company cant print or dilute, the market will never change… These rules cant change though… because if they do, why would you want to be PUBLIC!!! You, as a founder, owner, go public to enrich yourself, your family, and all your friends! Not to share wealth with others! Think of #1 priority of a CEO. Raise shareholder value to increase currency. Why this paragraph is important? We are seeing with Musk, offerings of small cap companies, what is done with stocks. This is not a new game, be prepared , yesterday more companies were hot and after the bell the companies which make no money did offerings… I read on social media that many shareholders, don’t understand why.. The CEO of Atlas trading, nearly 250k traders, is trading Pump and Dump stocks that are flying and then an offering comes…. I hope he is getting kick backs from the companies he is pushing… Either way a large group like that a text, tweet, discord message will shoot the stock up…. Remember the stock market is indeed a popularity contest!RAD is up 15% at the moment. I do have shares at 8.50. The truth is the company is indeed short 34%. Retail should be on RAD because it is heavy short, options are cheaper, and the company has a trajectory to be profitable. Oh year, they forecast sales for the year to be between 23 and 24 million! A $1 stock? At 9:30AM at open this may get a squeeze, there may be margin calls as this was 6.10 last week on the sell rating and $1 target… I am sure the shorts packed on. This is going to open near 9 and cause some margin calls and covering…..5 Trade ideas.RAD – As above stated, I will look to trade my shares for 20-25 cents and I will trade it as much as possible. The earnings were mixed, guidance slightly up. I did like that they paid down 200+ from debt and forecast a fairly strong EBIDTA. The company must execute. Being that the stock was so down, this is more like a relief rally and the valuation, than a strong performance. I am not saying the report was bad but it wasn’t not good. I am disappointed by the bottom line and must see the unbiased SEC filing laterVERU- This Bio tech had good Covid news and is up 150%+ this week. I have been watching it but did not do anything yet. I wont make a big bet but I do not mind puts if this keeps flying. The news was good but this is not a 1.25 billion dollar company. They do not have sales on the year of over 40 million! They lose moneyBBBY – Wow, those earnings were off a cliff awful. I did bid on Puts and cant believe when the stock turned positive near 18.75 I did not get filled. Sucks! I will try again today. That was absolutely atrocious those earnings. I do not even know if this stock is worth 10 anymore, that report was so bad.UPST – I just sold the 5/20 130 strike calls for 3.80. I will look at these calls again. This AI fin tech which matches loans with banks for end users has destroyed the last 4 quarters hence it went to 400! It was a MEME, and maybe it isn’t worth 400, well definitely not, but 150, with 100% growth and profitable? Ill buy that!TWTR – I have not purchased Calls or shares in TWTR for years. I am not sure how long but 3+. Musk offered 54.20, he does not have cash, he has made it a MEME.  It was 47-52 Premarket.

These are not easy questions to answer. You have to dig. Check out ASP, gross margin and operating margin for Tesla, as well as their trends. Understand Economies of Scale and Wright's Law. Look into the innovation that Tesla is attempting in building EVs. Finally, every quarter.. do your math! GAAP earnings per EV = (GAAP EPS \\\\* outstanding shares)/(EVs delivered). Use [ir.tesla.com]( as your source2) EVs sold annuallyThis is the biggest risk to Tesla and most important thing to monitor imo: execution. Their goal is 50% growth in sales YoY. To be bullish, we have to see them hit that goal.Homework: Do your math to predict sales based on 50% growth YoY, and watch to see if they achieve their goal. They sold 936,000 in 2021, if they grow at 50% YoY, what year will they reach 20M?3) P/EUnfortunately, there will always be speculation here. Tesla will likely always try to innovate and find new businesses to grow. They're currently focused on Solar and Energy, FSD and the Tesla Bot in addition to EVs. So long as there's new innovative business opportunities, what P/E value does that justify? Your homework is to make your own speculation here. 25 P/E? 50 P/E? 10 P/E?

Decide if this upside is really there, and if you decide that TSLA could continue to grow, then you're now equipped with some nice metrics to follow and help you maintain conviction in your holding.Happy rollercoaster riding friends 🎢\",\n",

JPMorgan will be the first of the top six banks to report earnings, with Wall Street focusing on how the volatility caused by the Ukraine war affected investment banking and trading operations.Treasury 10-year yields fell after reaching their highest level since December 2018.Oil has surpassed $100 per barrel.The rise in crude oil prices, along with other commodities, has fueled inflation fears, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. Gasoline prices accounted for half of the monthly increase in the US consumer price index in March. Nonetheless, core inflation increased less than expected, owing in large part to the largest drop in used-car prices since 1969 and a slowing in price growth in other merchandise categories.On the geopolitical front, Russian President Putin stated that peace talks with Ukraine have stalled and vowed to continue his military operation in the country, despite calling the conflict a \"tragedy.\" Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has called for additional European Union sanctions against Russia, including oil and all banks.# SPY - April 13 - Technical Analysis Break 439.76 and look for 441.71* Break 441.71 and look for 441.71 - 442.58* Beak 442.58 and look for 444.58 - 445.87 - 447.02* Lose 437.73 - 436.63 - 435.53 and look for 433.86* Lose 433.86 and look for 432.13 - 430.27* Lose 430.27 and look for 428.70* Lose 428.70 and look for 426.89 - 425.20 Wedge - Bullish Bias* Bullish 🎯: 445.88 - 450.27 ( needs to break 442.42)* Lose 433.79 and the pattern is null.

In his opinion, the Twitter Board and Musk could not come to an agreement around Musk\\'s communications with the public over Twitter as he likely needed to take a more back seat/quiet stance as part of joining the Board. Musk no longer joining the Twitter board could lead to a host of scenarios including joining up with a private equity partner and forcing major strategic changes at Twitter and/or a sale, creating more noise and angst for Twitter Board/execs with various proposed platform changes, or does Musk say \"game over\" reduce his stake and go home, Ives contends.

       " 'Buying OTM TSLA call options 3 DTE is very dangerous and sounds like something WSB would do.Doubling down and buying more $TSLA call options 2 DTE and 1 DTE is also something WSB would do.Yet, this is exactly what Hari did, as can be seen here: [TraderSync]( is a price chart of the 4/8 1125 $TSLA call last week. I have marked with a white oval the spots where Hari bought calls (some weren\\'t exactly the 1125 call but nevertheless still OTM).[where Hari bought]( the process, Hari turned a maximum $449 loss (original position was a CDS) into a $2085 loss, which is roughly 40-50% of Hari\\'s 5k account portfolio value, in one trade. This is absolutely horrible risk management. So unless you are a veteran swing trader with a very good understanding of options and have proper risk management, please DO NOT (SWING) TRADE OPTIONS. With options, you need to get three things right1. direction2. implied volatility3. theta decayand if you hold options overnight, vega and theta will eat you alive, as it did to Hari above. If you are just starting out and can barely get 1. correct, how can you expect to get 2. and 3. correct as well? One of the most important things to learn as a trader is proper risk management (e.g. I personally keep losses <10% on any position) and you can\\'t do that with options. Hari, whether you are able to double $5k is one thing, but whether you can teach a beginner to do it is another. Right now your trades are extremely risky (and the worrying part is a beginner might not know this and blindly copy you!) and as such you have huge drawdowns. While a 50% or 100% drawdown on a $5k account is nothing to you, I\\'m sure for a lot of people in this sub this is a nontrivial amount of money to lose. I really recommend you have better risk management in your trades in the $5k account going forward. Also for any of you in this sub that are blindly following Hari, please note that some of his trades/strategies are really not suited for beginners, including1. Buying back the short side of a debit spread: This is equivalent to doubling down on a losing position, because you are investing more of your money into the position. I personally would never do this, following Jesse Livermore\\'s rules.2. Trading Butterflies: The highest payout of this strategy requires you to hold it to expiration (so you need to predict the exact time) and predict the exact price, not just the direction! As seen in Hari\\'s $GOOG butterfly: [TraderSync]( trade, he got the direction correct but the price wrong, and lost 100% of his investment. I personally don\\'t trade butterflies, but if I did, I would use broken-wing butterflies. 3. Using RS/RW stocks to hedge: With this you are trying to have your cake and eat it too and it\\'s very tricky to get correct. I personally prefer holding a small position in SPY or UVXY options for 1-2 days as it does exactly what I want it to do: hedge. Finally, here is a quote by Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the best hedge fund managers in the past 30 years.>\"It\\'s not whether you\\'re right or wrong that’s important, but how much money you make when you\\'re right and how much you lose when you\\'re wrong.\" \\\\~Druckenmiller',\n",

Alle interviews bekeken van die Elon Musk en mensen rondom mij gevraagd of het wel verstandig is en hoe zei over $Tsla dachten. Niemand wist iets niemand durfde iets te doen. Toen op 11 Maart 2020 mijn positie in genomen. Ik was toen er heel erg cker van dat $Tsla een mooie toekomst tegen moet ging.[ zijn we hier 2 jaar later in een tijd dat alle legacy oem\\'s moeite hebben om auto\\'s te verkopen. Ze gooien het over de supply chain chip issue\\'s en covid-19 issue\\'s... Dat terwijl $Tsla nog steeds als een dolle productie aan het rampen is en meer auto\\'s produceert en levert als ooit te voren dit terwijl Austin en Berlijn dit jaar pas zijn open gegaan. VW gooit heel hun strategie om... Dit is wat ze een paar jaar geleden zeiden\"Former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal, had made it his goal to beat Toyota and General Motors to the title of “volume number one” by 2018 \"Dit is wat ze nu zeggen “The key target is not growth,” said Arno Antlitz, chief financial  officer, in a reversal of the stance taken by former VW executives.\"Zelfs hun Noord en Zuid amerikaanse markt zijn nooit ik herhaal nooit winstgevend geweest!\"In pursuit of global dominance, the Wolfsburg-based group retained a large presence in unprofitable North and South American markets, flooding the region with new models even as it sustained heavy losses.\"De auto fabrikanten zijn nu zo veel mogelijk hun duurste en winstgevende modellen aan het verkopen om hun winstgevendheid te behouden en dan praten we nog niet eens over de elektrische modellen van ze..De supply chain management van deze bedrijven is verschrikkelijk.. Ze verwachten dat de materialen om batterijen te produceren alleen maar goedkoper worden... Dus er komt meer vraag naar een materiaal dus de kosten van het materiaal gaat naar beneden? Dat slaat nergens op.. Tesla heeft langdurige termijn contracten met de mijners en zij hebben jaren erop gehamert bij elke earnings call is het aanbod gekomen. Naar een gerucht gaat dat zei in Shanghai alleen al een overvloed hebben van 250.000 auto batterijen dit jaar.“\\\\[These\\\\] $50,000 nickel prices per tonne were not basically priced in, because we expect, hopefully, the war will end soon, and then the raw material prices will at least go a little bit more back,” Antlitz said.\"[ je het artikel gezien 5-4-22 van het AD? \"Fiat word Tesla voor het volk\"... Ha als ik dat lees moet ik in mijn broek plassen van het lachen. De Stellantis CEO heeft op 2-12-21 gezegd dat zei niet EV\\'s winstgevend kunnen maken.\"What has been decided is to impose on the automotive industry  electrification that brings 50 percent additional costs against a  conventional vehicle. There is no way we can transfer 50% of additional  costs to the final consumer because most parts of the middle class will  not be able to pay.\"[ zeggen altijd oh als deze auto fabrikant op de markt komt dan is het gedaan met Tesla... Nee omdat ze niet dezelfde marges hebben kunnen zei nooit een product neerzetten die concureert met Tesla.\"Jah maar waarom zijn Tesla\\'s nu zo duur dan en niet goedkoper?\"Omdat er nog steeds een hele hoge vraag naar hun auto\\'s zijn en ze niet oneindige wachtrij willen hebben is het verstandig van ze om zich aan de markt clearing price te houden. Dit is al investeerder alleen maar heel erg stierig en verhoogd de winstgevenheid van het bedrijf alleen maar. Dit is alleen nog maar de auto bussiness waar ze totale dominantie hebben er zit nog veel meer aan te komen. Tesla word CHOAM.Ik behoud mijn Tesla positie\\'s de komende jaren en verwacht $1300-1600 eind dit jaar(mijn plan is om in juli/juni de call optie te verkopen ligt aan de fed rates en inflatie)(ligt veel aan de macro situatie\\'s) en in 2025 een aandeel prijs van zo\\'n ruim $5000 gebaseerd om een pe ratio van 100 en netto operationale winst van zo\\'n 50 miljard.Edit:Als je denkt en vind dat aandelen kopen van een bedrijf waar jij zelf goed onderzoek over hebt gedaan en volledig begrijpt zie ik niet als gokken. Wat ik zie als gokken? Ik heb weleens een call opties gehad van Tesla van 2 weken uit die mij 10.000 euro koste die ik 2 dagen voor de expiry datum verkocht voor 5.000 euro winst terwijl die 1 dag van de voren nog op verlies stond. Dat zie ik als gokken omdat op korte termijn heel veel macro gerelateerd kan gebeuren die niks te doen hebben met het bedrijf waarin je investeerd.VWRL etf kopen jah leuk als je een klein rendement wilt halen per jaar de komende 30 jaar... Ik heb geen plan om de komende 30 jaar voor een bedrijf te werken die mij vertellen wat ik moet doen op een dag. Dat noem ik moderne slavernij. Ik zal dan ook Leap call opties op Tesla blijven kopen en een deel van mijn optie geld door rollen naar nieuwe Leaps voor een steady inkomen.Ik ben best wel teleurgesteld in deze subreddit over beleggen met de reactie\\'s die ik heb gehad. Je raad alleen maar etf\\'s aan als je niet weet wat je doet. Remind deze post maar over 5 jaar. Na Cyber Rodeo de opening van de fabriek in Austin en Berlijn... Ze pompen rauwe materialen in de fabriek en er rolt een auto uit.. De komende 2 jaar word gebruikt voor de huidige producten te schalen ipv onnodige 25k auto op de markt te zettten.Ohjah de 25k auto daar wil ik ook nog iets over zeggen. Als je denkt dat je in de toekomst een 25k auto kunt kopen daar ben ik het niet mee eens. Ten eerste de inflatie en ten tweede de rauwe materialen om batterijen te maken die zal blijven omhoog gaan en niet omlaag gaan zoals sommige auto makers denken plus in de huidige markt situatie waarin de auto makers hun goedkoopste modellen als eerst verwijderen omdat ze te lage marges hebben op die producten. Nee idd ik zie niet in dat je een Bev kunt kopen voor 25k in de toekomst. Dit is mijn mening.',\n",

       " \"Just think about what you could do if you could 3x your money, guaranteed. You might actually be able to buy a boxable home in Austin and join the tech bros. You might even be able to buy a Tesla. If you don't want to help Tesla stock go to $3000 so that you can buy a Tesla and flex on your friends, then you are selfish and hate the environment. There is nothing better for getting pussy than flexing your wealth while carbon shaming all the poor people. Why do people have gas guzzling cars anyway? By increasing the amount of coal being burnt for all our Teslas we will accelerate the timetable for switching over to clean energy. By doing activist investing, and buying Teslas with those free money 3x gains, we can save the Earth and our bank accounts.Tesla is not a car company; it's an energy company. Teslas are the best cars made by any company on the planet. Or other planets for that matter. When Elon goes to Mars the Martians will buy Teslas so don't tell me how the Earth's population cannot support the current projections. Does Elon Musk use his tech bros following to make easy money on TSLA, doggy money, TWTR and other things? Probably, but that's the way it should be. Why should we let Bezos overtake our lord and savior Elon Musk? Investing in the 2020s is all about how you feel. By investing in TSLA you are donating to Elon Musk so that he can save the environment and colonize Mars. Mama Cathie says TSLA should grow to $3000 by 2025. The stock should just be $3000 now if it's going to be worth $3000 why isn't that priced in why wait 3 more years? Just buy it if it is below $3000. It's a free lunch. And don't forget to take your gains to buy a Tesla, unless you can't afford one. Then I guess you should just buy more TSLA calls until you can afford one. TSLA to the moon and beyond.\",\n",

       " 'Most analysts remain impressed with Tesla’s operational execution in the face of large industry supply-chain challenges, and with its pricing power which could enable it to more than offset steep raw materials pressure. Recent conversation with Tesla suggests it is well positioned to deal with current macro challenges, by capitalizing on its long-term contracts, strong purchasing power, and ability to diversify its battery chemistry to minimize use of expensive inputs. With the recent start of deliveries at the Berlin factory and upcoming one in Texas, most expect strong Tesla volumes this year.However, some analysts continue to question whether Q1 strength can sustain through the rest of the year given reduced visibility into both supply (increased supply chain stress following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and increasingly stringent COVID-19 restrictions in China expected to impact many manufacturers) as well as well as price, given battery metals cost inflation, which translate into higher prices for EVs going forward.[',\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone. I have done so much reading the past few weeks its an amazing things. I am even reading 3 books at the same time. I use the AMZN kindle. Lately I have been reading about Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong.. It never hurts to get a little knowledge. Many of you probably don’t know but these 3 leaders all lived all ruled within the last 100 years. Many of us know Hitler, because it was terrible how Hitler had picked out, in general 1 group of people the Jewish. But the cause of deaths under Hitler even with the war is under 10 million….. Lenin 20 million, Stalin, 40-50 million and Mao Zedong 50-80 million! These aren’t as public than Hitler because these other leaders killed their own people, not others. I wanted to read these books, Art of War, because what is going on with Russia/Ukraine and to get a better idea of leaders, what they do on war times… Why that matters to us, to the market? This war is going to affect our companies and us drastically. This isn’t a political sub, so I will not get into it to much. But basically, this war will not end. 1 of these leaders must be willing to give in. We all have different feelings of what is going on, but the more we arm Ukraine, the longer that the war will go on. I am not on the floor or a military leader so I can not make commands. However, what we know is that nearly 5 million refugees have left. \\\\[Ukraine had 45-50 million\\\\], 1 + trillion in damage of property. 10-15 million people are homeless or displaced, and it may get worse before it gets better. The war started 2/24/2022 and our companies were not affected 4th quarter of 2021. However, the 1st quarter is where we see the affects of this war on company. This war affects sales/as well as margins. Before the war started I had figured earnings were going to just barely pass. That is, most companies would meet top line \\\\[sales\\\\], bottom line \\\\[earnings\\\\], maybe beat them by 1-3% which is still a 65-70 grade. I have a video and post on earnings grades…. Once the war started it all depended on what was done and how long it was going to rage on. Many companies have boycotted Russia. This will be 1+ month affect on companies. Now, Russia is not China but it does make a difference for most companies. Hence, I changed my stance on earnings. Some reports will trickle in soon, however most companies report 3 weeks after a quarter ends…..Now some of my team is trying to get me to say an exact time when the coast will be clear. That I can not tell. I can tell you the 1st quarter reports will be bad, but how bad I can not tell you. April 1st started the 2nd quarter for most companies. We can tell what is going on by paying attention to news, reading articles, visiting stores, being aware of our surroundings. If I had to guess I would also say 2nd quarter will be bad, maybe worse than the first.. but we are 4 days in! So how can I tell you for sure.. What I can say is the mighty TSLA missed deliveries estimates of 312,000 coming in at 310,000. I can tell you they are expected to deliver 1.45 million cars 2022. In 2021 they came in at 936,000. I can tell you that TSLA canceled the cyber truck altogether and is doing refunds….. \\\\[By the way Toyota delivers 10 million cars a year, Volkswagen 9.5, GM 8… and TSLA is worth more than the top 10 Auto and the top 5 AI companies combined\\\\] Facts! However as I wrote before Musk is the #1 stock pumper in the world, Ryan Cohen is the #2….TWTR is actually a real company and fair value based on their last earnings and in a good market is about 45-50, the difference between GME, BBBY and TWTR is that TWTR is actually profitable and is growing. Their financials are such that they don’t need to flood supply with enw shares. As we saw last week, GME will be flooding to dilute when it splits… BBBY has been losing money, and their financials are ok now, but will get worse as they keep bleeding. I like TWTR and before the market decline this would have been a good trade/investment. Without Musk this is headed lower, as I have said the Nasdaq should be 12,500-13,000 as we enter this uncertainty. Things will be clear in 2-3 weeks with earnings, and if the Fed raises rates .5 and signals its going to keep going. Rates also crush a company by directly affecting its bottom line. It increases borrowing costs on old loans and affects their ability with new ones. 99% of companies have debt and 99% of the ones that do can not just pay them off. As I wrote weeks ago many companies can take on a .5-1% increase in rates but not a 1-2%.. It is estimated now that we will see 2% or above by years end! We were at .25!DWAC getting whacked. There is no official business, no sales, the site isn’t even fully running. About a month ago it hit 105! I was getting puts daily! I can not trade in hindsight and I cant blame myself. Because I have many puts that expire 4/14 because the market rallied on bad news from 12,500 to 14,300+ nearly 20% in 2 weeks! I do not have power to control the market, and in general people are bullish. Only a small % of people short so generally it is far easier to make money on the bull run. If most traders shorted as well, it would be just as easy to make money going down…. If you have 100 traders….. 95 are willing to buy shares and only 5 \\\\[if even that much\\\\] are willing to short it is obvious that it is easier to go up… this is an auction!Shanghai with 26 million is still shut down! This is the NY of China! China is not Russia. China is imperative to our companies… This affected part of Q1 and now is going into Q2.. The mighty TSLA missed deliveries….. What do you think will happen to what you trade????Over the weekend many on Reddit asked me about some grenades. You can make money on grenades. I saw a ton of posts on ATER.. But realize that your strategy here is hope. When the market is bullish a retail army can push stocks high without fear.. When things go down, guess who sells on fear? The Ape that cant pay rent! So, if you choose to trade these you also have to be willing to lose.I was trading shares of CONN, ONEW last week. Check their financials. PE ratios of 5! CONN earnings were not good, slightly bad actually but they still made money! And have a buyback!

So, this isn't going to be the best DD in the world, but I think it offers a pretty significant correlation between the $AAPL Daily chart that is referenced in the Result vs Effort Model that Richard Wyckoff taught.  we are expecting here, is one last spike in volume on the decline, before a significant increase in value. I'm predicting it to get into the low 900's, maybe 800's again one last time before value incentive really kicks in to take this baby beyond the stratosphere. Not to mention, Elon is splitting the stock because it is currently over bought. [Wyckoff Price Cycle Visual]( reason for Elon's stock split is to level out the growth of his company, creating more supply so the demand can continue to rise at a healthy rate. I believe this markdown (one more dip with a volume spike) will occur before the stock split in order to prepare $TSLA to be transferred into its new, healthier and more fruitful soil.

       " \"I've been investing in TSLA for years with some shares up 4000% and others up as little as 20%. My position is ~4600 shares along with some TSLA LEAPS. The valuation is $5 million. I have another $3 million in other assets (real estate and some Vanguard index funds).I have only focused on investing with size into TSLA and then some passive index investing with Vanguard. I'm not necessarily looking to sell off my TSLA now but I am exploring the idea of exiting a large portion so that I could reinvest into dividends, etc, and live off the income stream.I have shared this similar story in a few other subreddits and was recommended tickers like SCHD, QYLD, QYLG, XYLD, RYLD, YLDS, etc. Another person recommended I post here in the dividends community. If anyone has done this in a lump sum manner I'd be interested in what you did.Note: In the past, I avoided dividend investing because I'm in a high tax bracket and didn't want to pay extra taxes on dividends while I was still working (I figured I would focus on investing in a growth stock company I spent a lot of time studying where I knew that I wouldn't have to think about dividend income anytime soon).

It was coming off of great earnings, the company is profitable and although it could go down I did not understand the risk reward. There are plenty of companies that don’t make money, and wont make money for years to come. Also, COIN has become a Bitcoin Cyrpto tracker and no longer trades as its own company. Many of these are like that… But careful it is definitely hot money…. Weed was hot a couple of days last week and is cooling! COIN is indeed very profitable, but many of these Crypto stocks and weed stocks are not.Oil is down because the busiest city in China, Shanghai with 25 million people \\\\[NYC has 8 million\\\\] is shutting down for 2 weeks. It is the size of Texas. This will definitely crush companies, but the market doesn’t know until earnings comes. This will more than likely hurt the 2nd quarter earnings which end June 30th and reports come 3rd week of July. As I have written the war started 2/24/2022 and will effect the 1st quarter earnings.

TSLA said over the weekend they must shut down the China plant…. Now TSLA is finding a sneaky way to print more shares! They are doing a split! And while they split and the stock rises they will print brand new shares… SNEAKY! I have seen it in the past but rarely, its working the stock is rising. I am a little confused because the 4th quarter of 2021 was actually pretty good in terms of cash flow and financials, it was their best quarter I have ever seen and I had told the team, they actually may not need to print shares… Here we are just 7-8 weeks after their report and they are printing!PLNT now POLY was a fave during Covid. They are popular for headsets, and Bluetooth devices. In 2021 we traded it often from 20-30. It did cool off as did many Covid plays. They are profitable and make money and HP is buying in cash! HEAR does a lot of similar things and has flown off a bottom. The sales have come down, earnings as well, but they are still profitable. It is hard to value these companies with a PE ratio of 5-20 when you have companies that make no money, no sales and are worth 5-10-15 billion. It is not a good sign when retail pushes these meaningless companies. This morning MULN announced they are dumping… Can you blame anyone? This is very simple, not difficult. HYMC dumped more in shares than the entire company is worth and retail is still bidding it higher. Did AMC, GME print? You tell me!!We are having a record number of buybacks so far this year because there is a huge disparity of real and fake companies. Many real companies like CONN, AAN have a pe ratio of 4-10, make money, have cash flows but is disrespected by retail…. Then you have the complete opposite of companies that not only don’t make money, they lose money, tons, and to fund their bills they sell into retail and their stock flies… If I was a CEO I’d be mad too! Most companies buying back have very low PE ratios… It is easy to see who will print shares when they need cash!At the same time if you are scalping and trading and at least know the risk, keep going! I stopped throwing most grenades in October and havent throwing 1 since January 1st. I truly believe the Nasdaq will be 12,500-13,000 as I have wrote and can be worse depending on earnings, however, I do not know the exact time but I would say 3rd week of April to May 4th if not sooner…. I don’t control the market, most do not, so I will wait patiently before making a decision. I am down on most of my puts, and don’t want to open new ones unless something flies. It is hard to go against the market and can be painful.

       " \"I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030. From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs). They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology, although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame. Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution. I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty. If your bearish on Tesla I want to know why and if I'm missing anything in my arguments.\",\n",

TSLA is the only company I could imagine having violent/wide enough swings in a day to compare. So I'm curious if anyone does this consistently or if this is their goto. Not looking to replicate my gains this week normally, just curious on consensus. I made a quick couple hundred on 1 call and 1 put for TSLA today, but I just wonder if that's mostly due to the recent run-up and its especially volatile right now.TLDR: anyone do multiple 5-15 minute day trades a day as a main strategy, if so what tickers\",\n",
       " ' #### Key points:* Tesla stock is bouncing back after a heavy sell-off* Deliveries are on track to beat expectations, aided by the completion of Giga Berlin* Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes the company could produce 2M vehicles by end of FY22Even Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) couldn’t escape the vast market sell-off, throwing even the most safeguarded portfolios into the red at a time of such unprecedented economic uncertainty. Now though, investors should be keen to approach oversold companies with evidently firm financial fundamentals; cue Tesla.\\xa0Tesla sits above the competitive mist that so firmly grips the emerging EV market. IPOs, SPAC, and complete directional shifts have little effect on Tesla’s position as a prominent market giant, and it might be some time before anything changes.\\xa0Since the middle of March, Tesla has begun to rally again and the stock looks set to continue its gains into the coming months as strong delivery numbers are expected. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives points out that Tesla’s deliveries are trending well ahead of expectations based on the current demand trajectory in the March quarter. Ives believes the company could be on track to produce around 2M units by the end of FY22. Given this projection, Tesla stock still appears oversold despite the recent rally.Even the global leader of EVs wasn’t immune to supply chain disruption. In order to navigate bottlenecks in China, Tesla built Giga Berlin; a new factory capable of expanding production to about 500,000 units annually and will aid deliveries across Europe. The Model Y SUV will be the first to roll out of the factory in the next 18 months.\\xa0The opening of Giga Berlin welcomes a new page in the Tesla story. The recent risk-off mentality that distanced investors will likely be revoked in favor of Tesla’s seemingly never-ending growth story. TSLA stock currently trades at a small daily loss of 0.10% in a quiet break from its recent rally.\\xa0',\n",

       " \"Analysts view the opening of Giga Berlin as one of the biggest strategic endeavors for Tesla over the last decade and should further vault its market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path. With German authorities finally giving approval to officially begin production in Giga Berlin, this removes a major overhang on the stock over the past few months. The red tape and headaches seen around the delays/disputes opening up this flagship European factory has been frustrating for investors to watch unfold as many on the Street were doubting if Giga Berlin ever actually would open. The production importance of Giga Berlin to the overall success of Tesla's footprint in Europe and globally is very significant, as the current Rubik's Cube logistics of producing cars in China at Giga Shanghai and delivering to customers throughout Europe was not a sustainable trend. The Berlin factory establishes a major beachhead for Tesla in Europe with potential to expand this factory to production of \\\\~500k vehicles annually with Model Y front and center over the coming 12 to 18 months. With the race for electrification in Europe hitting another gear and competition for EVs increasing from every angle with VW among others doubling down on its EV ambitions, analysts view Giga Berlin as a major competitive advantage for Tesla to further build out its supply footprint in this key region.[\",\n",

       " 'Date: 2022-03-23 23:47:25, Author: u/The_Lotus_Kid, (Karma: 6243, Created:Jul-2017) SubReddit: r/WallStreetBets, [DD Click Here]( mentioned in this post: [TSLA]( 999.11(0.52%)|[GME]( 141(14.5%)| First off, congrats to everyone that made bank from that price action this week. It has been a refreshing change from all of the loss porn. Even though my tits remain jacked for the rest of the week and the short term momentum, I want to discuss my thoughts on GME, why it is a great LONG play based on fundamentals, and why I think it will be the next TSLA.First, these two companies have some essential similarities for my comparison1. They have a huge retail following and remarkably loyal/enthusiastic investor base2. Charismatic, passionate, and incredibly successful leaders in Cohen and Elon3. The companies are developing new tech to be leaders in a mostly untapped marketMy comparison on the fundamental side will focus on current day GME as compared to TSLA in 2017.........................................TSLA (2017).......... GME (today)Market cap............................71b........................10bShare Price.............................70...........................141Revenue................................11b..........................6.1bEPS.......................................-2.37......................... -5.25Current Assets.....................6.5b.........................2.6bCurrent Liabilities.................7.6b........................1.3bLong term debt....................11.6b......................40m (yes, million)So, looking at these numbers they are not perfect, but I think the same thing ultimately held TSLA back that will hold GME back from a fundamental perspective. This being EPS. Both companies proving to grow revenue, but not turning profit or creating cash flow. From a balance sheet perspective, GME is actually quite a bit better here with 2:1 assets:liabilities and essentially no long term debt. The cash burn for GME is a result of their investment into new streams of revenue and will hopefully start to show improvement in regard to EPS with the marketplace launch. This same lack of cash flow generation held back TSLA for years, but they did eventually turn positive in 2020 and guess what happened to the share price? Yep, rocket emojis.Tesla share price went from 130 in Jan, 2020 to 793 in Jan, 2021 (adjusted price for splits)I think long term, if you believe in the marketplace as a good move for the business of GME (as I do), we could see similar price action with institutional adoption and closed short positions over time.A couple of other things GME has working in their favor:1. Insiders really believe. Insider buys 104k shares the last 2 days, sells 743 shares (form 4 filing)2. Shrinking float. 76m shares - 13.6m(18% insiders) - 21.3m(28% institutions) - 10m (DRS) = 31.1mTLDR: GME is the next TSLA (in terms of stock performance). Once the marketplace starts to generate revenue and EPS turns positive we will see a TSLA-style run.Disclosure: 343 shares at 153 averageI like the stock',\n",

With 4 hours of sunshine per day and less than 3.2 MW of capacity, you would generate something around 500 kWh of power per day. That\\'s enough power for 10 houses per day. Hardly enough power to produce 1,000 cars a week.For context, BMW\\'s plant in Regensburg Germany has used [168 MWh]( in a year, which would be 460,000 kWh per day. So how much solar generating capacity would GigaBerlin need? 168,000 MWh / 365 / 24 = 19.17 MW power generating capacity needed, twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. That\\'s 7 times GigaNevada\\'s installed capacity. Also the sun doesn\\'t shine 24/7, even in Nevada.For Berlin to generate that much electricity from solar panels in March, they would need to install 120 MW of capacity--40 times what is currently installed in Nevada. (You would also need a massive battery system to discharge power when the sun isn\\'t shining). I have a feeling that if Berlin had installed that many solar panels, Elon would be talking about it all day long. He\\'s not.Conclusion: There\\'s no fucking way that Tesla\\'s Berlin Gigafactory is net-zero. They\\'re running off of German electricity, which means Russian gas.The kicker:Putin wants Germany to pay for energy imports using Rubles. Not only is Germany going to finance the Russian war machine, it\\'s also going to help prop up the Ruble--working directly against the sanctions that the rest of the world is trying to use to stop the war. Positions: Long-Dated Puts on TSLA. Remember my name.---Epilogue: I\\'m anticipating some counterarguments from people who don\\'t understand how electricity works:German Electric GridSome people might argue that the area of Brandenburg generates a lot of renewable energy. That\\'s true. It\\'s also irrelevant. It doesn\\'t matter where you connect to the grid--you\\'re either a net consumer or a net contributor. If the national electricity demand rises because you\\'re a net consumer, then the coal, gas, and nuclear plants will increase their output by adding more fuel. Solar and wind plants can\\'t do that because they rely on nature, not fuel. Here\\'s the definition of an [opportunity cost]( for the apes who don\\'t understand.Heat PumpsThese cut electricity costs. They don\\'t generate power.',\n",

By the time Texas Gigafactory opens up this will be around $2 Trillion overtaking Amazon and Google in Market Cap. Once the share price hits $2,000 Papa MUSK will announce a 10:1 split. This will lead to doubling of the valuation to $4 Trillion Market Cap hence overtaking Microsoft and Apple.Once it is the largest public company by Market Cap, Elon will announce another two Giga factory probably by end of this year. Once he does that Market Cap will reach $5 Trillion. This year Tesla is slated to produce approximately 2 Million Cars with Berlin and Austin factories coming online, the factories will be in full production by next year and another two factories going online they will be able to produce 5 million cars at the end of 2023.

These Model Ys are equipped with 2170s supplied by Giga Shanghai, unlike Giga Texas Model Ys which will be starting with 4680s and structural packs. Giga Berlin had been rumored to be ready to open since 4Q21, but Germany’s strict regulatory environment has frequently delayed the opening, nearly 2x longer than Giga Shanghai’s record construction time. In 2021, 50% of all Teslas were produced at Giga Shanghai, and it has become the international export hub. The opening of Giga Berlin is a critical step for Tesla to localize supply chains and production in Europe, and given the increased geopolitical tension focused on Russia and China, this plant derisks Tesla’s heavy China dependence.[',\n",

Did not let snow and water inside the pants at all!Very warm insulated layer inside, great for really cold weather. Wear thermal pants under it if you’re in really cold weather.The price was good, delivery was fast. I would recommend.UPDATE: uploaded picture showing how the pant buckle broke after only wearing the pants once when I went skiing.

The material feels like a cross between a nylon ski jacket and fabric. They don\\'t \"whistle\" as much when you walk. LOL. They also seem very warm.

Its a beautiful quarter point raise, Jpow hinted that the rest will be quarter points as well and the market loves it.2. Ukraine conflict has been fully priced in. Putin’s midlife crisis has hopefully come to a head and the sanctions being imposed have definitely shook him and his boys up. Its also made China realize the cost of doing war in a fully globalized economy. Barring any major escalations from Putin, the market will continue its uptrend.3. The global economy is sizzling hot.

Its because of heavy demand coupled with supply side hiccups and hangovers from covid. Its known as cost push inflation. So all the urchins out there trying to peddle some crap about hyperinflation and weimar republic are just abusing your pea brain for clicks.

Everything is pricey right now due to all the volatility, but calls are cheap relatively and in my opinion dirt cheap if you believe that the market is moving up hard.

       " \"Much has been made of TSLA stock price so:This is a rough guide for margin management. Might repost/edit as more information comes along. Not financial or investment advice. Assumptions: You like the stock. You want to hold on as best possible. If there are updates or corrections needed I'm happy to edit/revise. This is when your back is against a margin call, not necessarily to hedge against one, but it could potentially be used for that as well.Stock - Obviously if you hold other stocks that you don't have conviction on you can liquidate those stocks, but typically they are down as well unless they are inversely correlated with TSLA, if you had some speculative stocks that have ripped you could potentially sell in order to get cash. Generally stocks add to your margin equity so this usually helps against getting margin called, but then it adds cash reserves. This one is probably last resort. You can also write covered calls against stock it will trade off longer term possibilities but if it helps avoid selling stock at a loss it might be worth it.Calls that probably won't happen anymore given the strike or given the price, those moonshot calls you probably need to liquidate, they don't add to your borrowing power, and hoping that TSLA turns around tomorrow isn't a great tactic, we are all pretty sure it will turn around but time can be a major problem with optionsCalls that likely will turn around but you need to hedge - consider selling a covered call at a higher strike, yes this does make it more likely that you will lose your shares but at least it will be at a much higher price assuming you get assigned.Existing Covered/Naked calls - you can potentially roll down (lower strike) your Covered calls for a credit, this will increase your risk longer term at the expense of shorter term safety. You really shouldn't have naked calls on TSLA but I know you like to live dangerously.Naked Puts, probably need to roll out in time if they are really close to expiryCash Injections - If you have some money available in a spare checking account or other you can wire in money to your brokerage to help shore up the finances until we recover.Open to other suggestions, these are only ones I could think of at this time.\",\n",

Today is the fifth day of my using it, and when I checked my account at the moment of writing this review, it was almost $12,900, so I hope to get up to $19,000 by the end of the week!  My review of Bitcoin Auto Trader: Bitcoin Auto Trader consists of an ultrafast program that trades daily on a huge number of exchanges. The framework uses the latest technology in the market and the fastest machine learning, which gives this program an advantage over others. The product lost is only 0.07% after more than 6 years of software trading. Which means you\\'ll be really lucky if you lose money. As the probability of failure is less than 1%. Take this Wall Street!  framework-signal performs exchanges with 163 transactions in 35 countries, and the number of transactions for the year is higher - 4 million! When I checked the structure of the signs, I noticed that they have excellent reputation. In 2021 this trading application brought 723 million dollars of profit, which is 11% more than in Trader in 2020. Impressive profit! This year, even though the world markets are mired in the hustle, this TSLA Token has defined that he gets 650 million dollars of profit, although massive losses in the world stock markets. For 2 more years, I was desperately looking for some legal way to earn money on the Internet from home. Blindly believe in fantasy - to be untied from 9 to 5 work, to work in my spare time, and do what my soul wants. How does TSLA Token work? To use TSLA Token, you should open an account with a specialist and invest 250 dollars to activate the algorithm. At this step, you as a TSLA Token will save your account, following the rules in the individual region of TSLA Token. At this point, TSLA Token makes the exchange for you.  After a couple of days of using TSLA Token, I am really satisfied with the results. Spending the whole day, in front of your computer and waiting for TSLA Token to create new operations is extremely tiresome, it always performs operations in the right conditions, so most of the time it is idling, but you need to keep your computer on and remember that the exchange can take place at any time -when it will be the most profitable, so I just leave it in the background. Use this link to make a profit in 24 hours with the TSLA Token platform today! [Click here to join](',\n",

       " '(Edit ...somehow...half of this post disappeared. This is an attempt at rewriting it. If you somehow read it beforehand and I forgot something, please feel free to poke me.)Also had a question with this one by a good friend here -- it is nothing special and I\\'m sure there are others who do it way better, but this is how I do it.Please, obligatory \"use a paper trading account\" if you\\'re going to try this out. I\\'m not even going to suggest only 1 share, since 1 share can easily lose you $30 on a bad day.DISCLAIMERPlease keep in mind - I am a super long term investor in TSLA. It is why I can scalp it without a care in the world - if it goes south, I just added a bunch more shares for possible long term, or I swing it until it comes into profit. *Owning TSLA shares for me is not a bad thing. It is how I got to where I can day trade.* This is not true for everybody.What are the charts?* SPY on M1 (...please don\\'t kill me Hari)* QQQ on M1 to look for confirmation and RS between SPY and QQQ, and QQQ and TSLA* TSLA or your stock of choice, on M1What\\'s the setup?* SPY needs to be on an uptrend (safest play is SPY on an uptrend, over VWAP). You can do it when you see any spikes going up (even during a downtrend or under VWAP), but it\\'s a lot more risky and you\\'re more likely to get caught* QQQ should be in coordination or with RS to SPY -- it should be in lockstep* The stock you pick needs to have RS (trying to scalp without RS is very very hard)Example Trade[TraderSync log]( M1, regular candles]( M1, regular candles]( M1, regular candles]( play by play (times in Pacific, unless otherwise noted)1. SPY is on an uptrend and over VWAP at this time in the chart - checkbox #12. QQQ gains RS as well as mirroring SPY at this time - checkbox #23. TSLA gains RS at around 9:45AM - checkbox #3, it\\'s go time* At 9:43 on SPY, I see a green candle. At this point I\\'m engaged, and I actively look for an entry on TSLA. I\\'m looking for a pullback to the 8EMA as some sort of entry. I get my pullback at 9:45AM and put in my limit order for 840 (why 840? Because it\\'s easy to type). The order fills for 840 at 12:45:27 market time.* I\\'m watching this tick by tick now. I am watching SPY much more closely than TSLA -- I keep an eye on TSLA and its price action to make sure checkbox #3 is still true, but I am watching SPY\\'s candles for signs of weakness.* 9:45 - red candle on SPY should scare me a bit, but I\\'m looking for a green one to continue the upwards movement.* 9:46 - I get my green candle, and am looking for another, while keeping an eye on TSLA and QQQ.* 9:47 - There\\'s a red candle there, but I\\'m not too worried yet. Why? The candle doesn\\'t break the halfway point of the previous green. Is this the right thing to do? Who knows. But I\\'m looking for another green one after this.* 9:48 - I get a red candle, and I see it trying to move down. What I want to see is a test of the 8EMA and bounce back as if to say \"AIYEE HOT\" (as I rewrite this, why is that the only real part I remember?) -- it does not, and I get out. I have my order filled out already and check TSLA\\'s price. I type in 844 (again, easy to type) and the order fills at 844.6976.I\\'m really looking just to ride quick movements, usually within a 5-minute candle. A $1 gain is honestly all I need, as that alone fulfills my daily goal. Anything past that is icing on the cake.This method probably works with any stock (at least replace the sector ETF with the right one), but honestly, I\\'m not brave enough to try. Again, the only reason I do this with TSLA is because I do not mind owning the stock.Edit: I did forget something. My timing still needs to be improved on this. There are times when my entries are horrible, and times when I leave money on the table exiting too early. It works well enough for me, but there is a LOT to improve on.I sincerely apologize if I may have forgotten anything during this 2nd write through, but hope this helps, and if not, at least convinces you I\\'m beyond crazy and makes you avoid me like the plague.',\n",

As I mentioned earlier, I own a Tesla.As of late with gas prices, I’ve been communicating with many colleagues asking about my Tesla, experience, how it works, what do I pay to charge etc. This is a big deal. Germany and other Europeans have been moving away from ICE. They’ve legislated banning ICE vehicles by 2030-2040 based on different countries. Tesla is the number one EV in Europe and with their vertical integration, and battery technology and supercharger network in Europe, China, Middle East and North America, Tesla has built the perfect storm company.I’m my opinion, as apple was perfectly timed for the iPhone, Tesla is 10x more perfectly timed.Their solar and battery products are so demand constrained it’s insane. As soon as they ramp supply, they’ll print. I have a model S. Im waiting for my solar and battery for my place and my parents place. My neighbor was an earlier adopter.

       " '### The Broader MarketsLast Week – SPY closed higher in a volatile week by about 0.5%, inside the 2.4% options were pricing. However, it was lower by almost 5% mid-week before a rally into Friday.This Week – SPY options are pricing about a 2.2% move this week (about $10 in either direction).Implied Volatility / VIX – The VIX closed last week just above 27, similar to where it started the week, but was 37 mid-week. As mentioned the past few weeks, traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop as it has been changing fairly significantly day to day (and even intra-day).Expected Moves for This Week (via Options AI)* SPY 2.2% (about $10)* QQQ 2.8% (about $10)* IWM 2.9% (about $6)* DIA 2% (about $7)### In the NewsTesla (TSLA) stock’s breakout in the Fall of ’21 took it from under $800 to over $1200 in the span of a few weeks. After a late year pullback to under $900 it made another run to $1200 to start 2022. During the market lows of last week it traded as low as $700 before finishing the week back above $800. In other words, it’s been volatile. Options have a difficult job pricing those sorts of stock moves. Looking ahead, options are pricing about a $45 move in either direction for this week and about a $105 move for the month of March, even though the stock has seen those types of moves in a single day recently. of the money calls were typically skewed higher (IV) when the stock was making its run higher last year. That has not been the case recently with a more normal curve skew (over the next few weeks) and Put/Call ratios just slightly tilting towards calls.Bottom line, Tesla options have been underpricing most of the stock’s moves since last Fall and and continue to price moves of only about $100 month to month. Options implied volatility doesn’t always reflect realized volatility because market makers don’t want to be caught holding the bag on theta and collapsing IV when the music stops. But in this case TSLA stock has been moving wildly since its big breakout and hasn’t stopped making large percentage moves, both higher and lower, since.## Earnings*Links* go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

       " 'So, everyone\\'s been moving along for a while now. If you aren\\'t already, track your progress somehow, even if it\\'s just noting your feelings in a journal. Or you may need some new/improved measures.Let\\'s start with apps/products and basic approach in general. People have already mentioned sleep tracking apps, I use a scale with BIA, and I bet people are using smartwatches for easy tracking. Whatever you\\'re using (and if you add something from below), don\\'t get caught up in the accuracy and precision. None of this shit is accurate -- and that does not matter! Look for *consistency* and use averages to wash out deviations.Example: Your 45lb plate at the gym... it doesn\\'t weigh 45lb. Every plate is usually within +/- 10% of the stated weight. Some of the common brands up to 20%. Do you suddenly care? I hope not. It\\'s your only option to continue. And you\\'ve consistently used the same plates and any progress scales the same anywhere else (+20lb is still +20lb, regardless of starting at 90 instead of 100). Besides, as you continue to add plates, individual plate deviations will cancel each other out.Sleep -- easy, three measures... Step 1: Get about 8 hours. If you naturally wake up sooner (7 hours? 7.3333 hours?) and feel well rested, go with that number instead of 8hr. Step 2: Go to sleep and wake up at consistent times. If your schedule allows, even better if your bedtime matches the onset of your sleep drive and you can wake up naturally without an alarm. Step 3: keep some a note of sleep quality (could be as simple as a mental note answering: did wake up feeling refreshed?) // Take note of your biological sleeping preferences. Your intuition is probably correct, but if you want a tool, check out a couple questionnaires: [Morningness-Eveningness]( and [Chronotypes]( If you\\'re using apps, like SleepScore, remember to ignore its accuracy and focus on the fluctuations.Nutrition -- calories are still our means of control, but every measure is shitty. The number on package is certainly wrong -- especially if it\\'s marketed for health (\"0 calorie\" items still have calories, supplements with individual ingredients aren\\'t required to report calories, \"net carbs\" is code for \"sugar alcohols are here to destroy your asshole,\" and so on). Use serving sizes and macros if you can. If not, focus on the hand measures for portion control. Both methods are less stressful and just accurate, yet still consistent.Weight/Body -- scale to measure total weight, try a BIA scale in the same price range for a bodyfat% measure (can be off by more than 7% and may work different with dry/moisturized/wet feet or may never give you a consistent read-out, unfortunately). Cheap and easy for all, but don\\'t use it alone. Can also [get BMI]( from this, three measures for one quick step (note: *the only people who hate on BMI didn\\'t actually read the guidelines and don\\'t know how/when to apply it*). Average for weight for an entire week (or 2-week average) and compare weekly averages -- no individual day matters. Ribbon/Sewing tape costs about $1 or maybe $3 for the fancy retractable one. Measure the circumference at the widest point of the exact area you want to see shrink or grow. Combine with scale results to determine real progress (weight may not change, yet gut shrinks, which is more important). Couple a waist measurement (healthy limit: 40in. men, 35in. women) with your BMI category (which is the actual [application for determining risk]( Measure hip girth with waist to get your waist:hip ratio (healthy limit: 0.8 men, 1.0 women). I prefer to measure on twice weekly, Saturday and Sunday, measure the same area twice each time, then average all four. Monthly, every other week, or just as needed are perfectly fine -- daily is just a hassle. Calipers are useful and more accurate for BF%, so long as it\\'s in the hands of someone experienced. Apply the same protocol as the measuring tape, except take 3 or 4 measures per site.[Edit: and pay attention to how your clothes fit and how you look in the mirror. Body composition can change without a weight change. Progress pics are also still useful even if you never show anyone else.]Stress Management -- everything that was posted last week, just keep track of yourself -- your stress and your relaxationWorkouts -- unlimited number of measures. Just be smart and pick the ones that are actually relevant to progress toward your goal -- volume, frequency, intensity, weight, range of motion, distance, RPE, duration, sets, reps. Most importantly, make sure you always progress the *skill* of any movement first.And the rest of your life. Don\\'t forget to you can be better elsewhere. And don\\'t neglect anything else important.Next week: personal reflection',\n",

The analyst says renewed supply chain concerns combined with higher oil prices enhance Tesla\\'s competitive advantage over legacy internal combustion engines. Tesla\\'s ability to export out of \"cost-efficient\" China and its history of better managing chip shortages in 2021 could strengthen its competitive position under the current Russia/Ukraine situation, Nathan tells investors in a research note. Further, higher oil prices and the potential of fuel shortages, especially in Europe, could accelerate the shift to electric vehicles, adds the analyst.',\n",

Hopefully this spurs some conversations for long time bulls as well as new shareholders.Raw P&L pull in Google sheets here: [ Top and Bottom-line (actuals and forward consensus):\\\\- 2019 actual: $24.6B revenue (+15% y/y), $0.04 EPS (flipped from unprofitable in 2018)\\\\- 2020 actual: $31.5B revenue (+28% y/y), $2.24 EPS (+5,500% y/y lol)\\\\- 2021 actual: $$53.8B revenue (+71% /y), $6.78 EPS (tripled y/y)\\\\- 2022 est: $81.8B revenue (+52% y/y), $10.50 EPS(+57% y/y)\\\\- 2023 est: $104.3B revenue (+28% y/y), $13.45 EPS(+28% y/y)\\\\- 2024 est: $144.6B revenue (+21% y/y), $15.99 EPS (+19% y/y)\\\\- 2025 est: $194.0B revenue (+14% y/y), $18.44 EPS (+15% y/y)\\\\- 2026 est: $233.6B revenue (+20% y/y), $23.06 EPS (+25% y/y) - seems like a boost from something modeled?\\\\- 2030 est: $339.7B revenue (up about 50% from 2025),  $35.29 consensus (which is only about double from 2025 over five years).2022 consensus EPS is $10.50. So $700 would imply 67x P/E. If you use 2023 EPS, it's at about 52x. If you take a 10 year view (8 year in this case) which is what it seems like the street is trying to price TSLA at... 2030 consensus EPS of $35.29 translates to 20x PE at $700/share.You can see a sharp drop off on growth expected for next year and from there on - especially strange given Austin and Berlin coming up like many of you pointed out in the comments. There's also no expectations for TSLA to gain further operating leverage or increase high-margin revenues from full self driving.\",\n",
       " 'TL;DR: In one historical case of how short sellers attacked Tesla, CleanTechnica\\'s writers were confused as fuck that UBS\\' analyst Colin Langan recommended selling TSLA 18 times (!) but never General Motors in over 2 years. This is all while secretly UBS had a giant open put position on the stock.EDIT: Wow getting downvoted off the bat to 66%. So while you bots are here, also fun facts for UBS: UBS had a bank account for Osama Bin Laden (yes that one) and also runs the biggest dark pool ATS in the United States.FUCK YOU CUNTS: Proof I\\'m getting downvoted:   [ off, a shoutout and unbelievable amount of props an to u/welp007 and u/PtahandSuns for catching the Musk piece and his bak-and-forth on Twitter (!) I wanted to actually drop something in that could be relevant for some of you unfamiliar with TSLA\\'s history with short sellers. took this from an old series on UBS and tracking their short selling history from 2001-2021. I brought this up recently some time back in a comment chain with u/alilmagpie and others (will have to look up!), but thought might be helpful here! Sept. 2016, CleanTechnica’s Maarten Vinkhuyzen reported that UBS has been bearish on TSLA for quite some time. Like...a longgggg time. the shade thrown harder than a solar eclipse on a Madagascarian gnat’s penis as Maarten tears into one of UBS\\' analysts:>“That analyst is Colin Langan. Non-journalists with a stronger journalist gene than CNBC’s reporters (damnnnn GOT EM\\\\*\\\\*) found did some sleuthing and found that this \\\\[UBS\\\\] analyst has recommended selling TSLA 18 times (!) in the past two years \\\\[2017-2018?\\\\]. He hasn’t recommended buying TSLA\\\\*\\\\* *at all* (emphasis theirs).”  >  >“Furthermore, this UBS analyst has recommended buying GM stock over two dozen times in the 7 years he’s been covering the company. He has *never* recommended selling GM.”[Hi Colin Langan, you smug fuckface]( added even more detail, like going into how UBS seemed to make lots of its arguments against Tesla on perhaps faulty info:>“When you look at this information, you have to wonder, why is Colin Langan so bearish on Tesla?  >  >When you look at the UBS report, you have to wonder, why did the report’s analysts do such a crappy job trying to estimate component prices?  >  >You have to wonder, why did UBS come up with such a dramatically higher cost estimate for the Model 3 than other independent examinations cost estimates...One of the fun gems Galileo Russell pulled up in this video was a reminder that it was UBS that falsely claimed in 2016 that Tesla’s battery pack costs were $260/kWh. On a conference call in which the same Colin Langan was discussing this matter, Tesla’s head of investor relations, Jeff Evanson, joined the call to correct the record and share that Tesla’s battery pack costs were $190/kWh at that time. That’s just a reminder of how bad UBS assumptions about Tesla have been for so long.\"This all gets covered again later in the website’s “Analysis: Sloppy UBS Tesla Burn Is Not Supported By UBS’s Own Numbers” which you can read more on here: [ final follow-up quote is added to the very end of Maarten\\'s Sept. 10th piece, with perhaps tales of things to come for the auto company:>“Update → One note Maarten dropped into the comments is that UBS has a large TSLA short position, which you can track to some degree on Fintel.io. As one reader summarizes it, “UBS Group AG has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (TSLA) in the form of stock options. The firm currently holds 314,690 call options valued at $107,923,000 USD and 1,302,400 put options valued at $446,658,000 USD.”Surprise fucking surprise...UBS analyst talks shit about the company as Maarten and Co. discover these fuckers actually have a HUGE open put position on Tesla.TL;DR: In one historical case of how short sellers attacked Tesla, CleanTechnica\\'s writers were confused as fuck that UBS\\' analyst Colin Langan recommended selling TSLA 18 times (!) but never General Motors in over 2 years.

They kept me at the right temperature, warm without overheating, and they\\'re thin enough to allow comfortable movement and a full range of motion during activities like canoeing or hiking. The weather on my trip wasn\\'t super cold (certainly warmer than winter in upstate NY), so I can\\'t promise that these will stand up to all conditions, but layering is key anyway and these can provide a good starting point.I was generally very impressed with the fit; I followed the instructions and ordered a size up, and that was definitely a good idea (although if they\\'re going to *tell* you to order a size up, I don\\'t know why they can\\'t just design the product to fit as expected). The fit was excellent overall; the top is surprisingly flattering (I actually wore it on its own for a while after returning from the excursion), and the legs, while unsurprisingly too long for my 5\\'3\" frame, could be easily rolled up without creating awkward bulk.My only issue is with the waist band, which is very narrow. The combination of narrow and elastic just isn\\'t a good one, because it leads to uncomfortable biting in that one place. I wish all pants designers would adopt the more comfortable and flattering wide yoga-pant-style waistband. But fortunately there was a relatively straightforward solution to my problem: I just tucked the shirt into the waistband, which significantly increased the comfort at some cost to aesthetics. It was a little bit awkward trying to arrange the relatively long shirt inside the close-fitting pants, but it was completely doable and worth the effort.Overall, I\\'m really happy that I bought these, and I\\'m impressed with the quality given the low price.Read more39 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tRMD\\tTOP 1000 REVIEWERVINE VOICE5.0 out of 5 stars exactly what i wanted and needed!!Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019Verified Purchasei read a ton of the good and bad reviews prior to purchasing. i needed these in a hurry for a winter boston trip and bit the bullet and just did it. i ordered an XL in the white and black - i am 5\\'8 and a little on the fluffier side - typically wearing a 14-16 (for now). the XL was perfect! i was really worried based on the reviews and nearly ordered a XXL in one color and XL in the other.

On the plus side, they\\'re thick enough that I can wear regular bikini shaped underwear with no lines.The top is really what saves them for me, I quite like it. I knew it would be a little big on me just because I carry my weight in my legs, but it still fits perfectly fine. I like the microfiber lining that makes it very warm for it\\'s \"weight\". I hate wearing bulky clothes especially for sleeping, so it\\'s good for that. My only concern is that I have a feeling this is the kind of material that will never ever let go of BO if I sweat in it....and I probably will because it\\'s a sweaty material.18 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tKristy3.0 out of 5 stars Very warm and softReviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019Verified PurchaseI ordered the medium in black because a lot of the reviews said to go up a size, i would have normally gotten a small. I am 5\\'3 about 120 pounds. When I received the item it wasn\\'t as snug fitting as I wanted but it still worked under my clothes and they are very nice and warm. I decided to order another set in a size small. When i received them they were a lot tighter. I washed the first set and noticed that the tags were LARGE!! No wonder they were kinda loose. I checked the bag that they came in and it said medium on the outside but I received large. So now I have a large set and a small set. The medium would have been perfect. So make sure you check your tags for the size other wise I think they are wonderful. The inside is a very soft fleece and the outside is a slick fabric that slides nice underneath clothing. The only reason I\\'m giving it 3 stars is because they sent the wrong size and I could not return because they were washed and tags removed.25 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tsunkissed4.0 out of 5 stars Definitely warm but short!Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018Verified PurchaseThese kept me warm on a trip over seas during snowfall. The material inside is soft to the touch and very comfortable. I like that material outside is sleek - it didn\\'t catch on my pants or shirts/sweaters. A warning though- these are very short. I am 5-8 and they did not come close to reaching my wrists or ankles. This didn\\'t bother me in the least but I can see how it might be annoying for others. I would still purchase again, just would be nice if they were longer.18 people found this helpfulHelpful### [Buy Now From Amazon!](',\n",
       " 'Tesla  is having a bad day that just got a little worse.Things began with CEO  Elon Musk  taking heat over his use of Twitter (ticker: TWTR). Then media outlets, including Barron\\'s, reported that safety authorities have opened an investigation into  Tesla\\'s  driver- assistance features.The third bit of negative news is that  Tesla  (ticker: TSLA) is slipping in Consumer Reports\\' automotive brand rankings, although the reason cited probably won\\'t be a huge concern for people who are upbeat about the stock.Consumer Reports ranks car brands annually based on multiple factors including driving tests, reliability, customer satisfaction, and safety.  Tesla  came in 16th in 2021, but fell seven spots to 23rd in the 2022 rankings.  Ford Motor  (F) rose three spots to 22nd, one ahead of  Tesla . Tesla\\'s  overall score is 60. Subaru (7270.Japan), the top brand, scored 81.  Jeep , the last brand in 32nd place, scored 45. The average score of the 32 brands ranked is 65.5.In 2021,  Tesla\\'s  score totaled 66.\" Tesla  dropped seven spots due to the difficult-to-use yoke steering wheel the auto maker added to its Model S and Model X vehicles, affecting their road-test scores,\" reads the report.The steering wheel seems to have been the key. The remark about the yoke was the only reference to  Tesla  in the written portion of the report. Consumer Reports didn\\'t immediately respond to a request for comment asking for more detail.The good news is that  Tesla  scored well on owner satisfaction. Drivers are happy with their Teslas. Tesla  stock was down 3.7% in midday trading Thursday. It\\'s hard to figure out exactly what is pushing shares down.Earlier in the day, the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  disclosed on its website that it is looking into reports of \"phantom braking\" on  Tesla  cars. That means one of  Tesla\\'s  driver-assistance features, automatic braking, might not be working as intended.And Musk tweeted out a picture of  Hitler  in response to a tweet linking to a story about how Canadian officials were handling protests against vaccine mandates in their country.Then there is the problem that the market is weak. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are off 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively.Whatever the reason, the Consumer Reports score isn\\'t helping.With Thursday\\'s declines,  Tesla  stock is down about 16% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite, for comparison, is off about 11%.',\n",
       " 'I got my first taste Jan 30th when I went heavy on calls on that crazy dip to $800 to Feb 1st when it hit $945 and I sold those calls for a very large profit (these were $900 strike, April calls I was prepared to hold to for months because I\\'m a TSLA bull). I then did it again, and again, and again and I\\'m about to buy again today.This isn\\'t normal right? Has TSLA always been a money making tick-tock like this? Theta Gang, is it normal for the price of options to swing so much with the stock price volatility? Who is so dumb they are selling call options so cheap in the trough of a dip that will only last 36 hours? Who is buying calls at such high premiums at what is at best a plateau if not the peak before a \"correction\"? Even a hardcore bear can\\'t possibly believe that every dip is the start of TSLA going bankrupt (I could see any number of Bulls seeing $925 as a bargain with eyes to $1800 by year end, so that part is less crazy to me). With my sale yesterday I\\'ve seen a more than 100% return and I\\'m a complete novice just waiting for the other shoe to drop.I see it as a minimal risk thing since if the call option value doesn\\'t go up, I can just hold it because I really am a Bull and only buy options I think will make it past break even before expiring. My biggest risk is selling expecting another dip and that dip never coming, but I\\'ve already made as much as I expected to make holding the calls long.Theta Gang, tell me how I will go bankrupt before I do it.EDIT: Well, I went in light on calls at $75 yesterday (2/17) and it\\'s down to $55 right now debating where the floor is going to be to double up and bring my cost basis down. There are press attacks coming from a lot of angles right now (SEC scuffle, Consumer Reports FUD, Elon tweeting about Hitler, fear that 5billion stock gift will be liquidated), so I think it will actually go lower today. Thinking about maybe doing a shorter term option this time since the rebound from Y delivers out of Austin will happen very soon.EDIT2: I was still holding those $75s, but also got $20s on Thursday (24th) morning (moved basis to $47.5) that made up for them just now at $63 (28th, morning). I still think there is no problem going long to April, but I\\'ll be able grab another dip before then.EDIT3: I grabbed the Mar 14th dip big (25) at $16 and just sold them today Mar 22nd at $116.

We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)Let\\'s start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:* Tesla\\'s car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself]( Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).* Tesla is... *ETF?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.Let\\'s start with an automotive sales part:* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current ASP is $50.7K, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be $66.2K (50.7 x 1.03\\\\^9)* With net margins of 13% that would result in 66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income.* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive Tesla PE of 15.* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) 172B x 15 = 2.58T. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3\\'s)?* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\\\^9 = 1.4T\\\\*, so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or 12.5% annually. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let\\'s discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.Chapter 2. Automotive market.Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source]( Citation: \"... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ...\". From this we can assume EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called \"New Energy vehicles\" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source]( So EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source]( i.e. 50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source]( Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn\\'t locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of 20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source]( China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = 0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source]( global automotive sales should reach 122.8M units by 2030. Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain 62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030. It is important to understand that this is a bullish estimate rather than the base. First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source]( 3. Tesla\\'s market share.From [EV-Volumes.com]( we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It\\'s easy to estimate Tesla\\'s market share from this graph:* 2018: 245K / 2082K = 11.8%* 2019: 367K / 2276K = 16.2%* 2020: 500K / 3240K = 15.4%* 2021: 936K / 6750K = 13.9%Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla\\'s market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla\\'s market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y\\'s original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.Despite all that, let\\'s consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain 8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030. This is whopping 56.5% lower than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030. An annual return of 2.5% (below inflation) if you invest at current prices.Chapter 4. ASPPerhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source]( It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).According to the latest [Toyota Financial report]( (Q1-Q3 combined) ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it\\'s a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, Tesla\\'s 2030 ASP is $49.5K (38K x 1.03\\\\^9) or 25% lower than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.Deducting these extra 25% results in TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B, or -0.7% annual return if you invest today. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.Margins.One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter pollsWhen we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source]( and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source]( Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings total share dilution to 10.3% (1.011\\\\^9).On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn\\'t play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).The results:If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:* our estimated target for market cap of 840B USD, * and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\\\\^9 / (1.103) = 323B USD todayOr with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = 287 USD per share todayFor Tesla bulls: before you say it\\'s outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn\\'t even account for.Chapter other product lines of Tesla:As for the other product lines, it\\'s difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source]( Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source]( have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla\\'s valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.Chapter Hype: Fraud Self DrivingThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*Since Tesla doesn\\'t share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon\\'s statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa\\'s challenges and even before.But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source]( For the sake of the argument, let\\'s say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\\\\*\\\\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That\\'s where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that\\'s where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it\\'s one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.Chapter Hype: To be continued...I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla\\'s ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.Chapter History.A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was the *stonk* in 2000. Cisco actually was the World\\'s biggest company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista]( SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today\\'s dollars.And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article]( claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed]( Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven\\'t recovered to it\\'s ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.It doesn\\'t really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?ConclusionMy conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz \"announced\" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn\\'t we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....',\n",

       " 'No emotions, minimum speculations, just raw impartial numbers. We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA.Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)Let\\'s start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:* Tesla\\'s car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself]( Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).* Tesla is... *ETF?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.Let\\'s start with an automotive sales part:* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current ASP is $50.7K, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be $66.2K (50.7 x 1.03\\\\^9)* With net margins of 13% that would result in 66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income.* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive Tesla PE of 15.* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) 172B x 15 = 2.58T. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3\\'s)?* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\\\^9 = 1.4T\\\\*, so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or 12.5% annually. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let\\'s discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.Chapter 2. Automotive market.Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source]( Citation: \"... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ...\". From this we can assume EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called \"New Energy vehicles\" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source]( So EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source]( i.e. 50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source]( Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn\\'t locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of 20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source]( China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = 0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source]( global automotive sales should reach 122.8M units by 2030. Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain 62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030. It is important to understand that this is a bullish estimate rather than the base. First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source]( 3. Tesla\\'s market share.From [EV-Volumes.com]( we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It\\'s easy to estimate Tesla\\'s market share from this graph:* 2018: 245K / 2082K = 11.8%* 2019: 367K / 2276K = 16.2%* 2020: 500K / 3240K = 15.4%* 2021: 936K / 6750K = 13.9%Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla\\'s market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla\\'s market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y\\'s original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.Despite all that, let\\'s consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain 8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030. This is whopping 56.5% lower than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030. An annual return of 2.5% (below inflation) if you invest at current prices.Chapter 4. ASPPerhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source]( It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).According to the latest [Toyota Financial report]( (Q1-Q3 combined) ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it\\'s a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, Tesla\\'s 2030 ASP is $49.5K (38K x 1.03\\\\^9) or 25% lower than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.Deducting these extra 25% results in TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B, or -0.7% annual return if you invest today. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.Margins.One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter pollsWhen we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source]( and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source]( Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings total share dilution to 10.3% (1.011\\\\^9).On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn\\'t play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).The results:If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:* our estimated target for market cap of 840B USD, * and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\\\\^9 / (1.103) = 323B USD todayOr with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = 287 USD per share todayFor Tesla bulls: before you say it\\'s outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn\\'t even account for.Chapter other product lines of Tesla:As for the other product lines, it\\'s difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source]( Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source]( have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla\\'s valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.Chapter Hype: Fraud Self DrivingThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*Since Tesla doesn\\'t share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon\\'s statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa\\'s challenges and even before.But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source]( For the sake of the argument, let\\'s say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\\\\*\\\\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That\\'s where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that\\'s where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it\\'s one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.Chapter Hype: To be continued...I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla\\'s ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.Chapter History.A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was the *stonk* in 2000. Cisco actually was the World\\'s biggest company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista]( SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today\\'s dollars.And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article]( claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed]( Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven\\'t recovered to it\\'s ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.It doesn\\'t really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?ConclusionMy conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz \"announced\" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn\\'t we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....Edit: since many people are so kind to ask me to short Tesla, I just wanted to make clear I already shorted: [positions]( Main position is 25x 250p Jan\\'23.',\n",
       " '* All EV stocks LCID, Chinese names suffer the same fate.* Tesla once again is targetting its 200-day moving average.Tesla (TSLA) followed many EV names (all, if we are correct) lower on Friday as macro factors took charge over equity markets. The dominant theme so far in 2022 has been one of rising rates and inflationary pressures. This has led to high growth and tech names underperforming, while energy and financial stocks have been the place to be. That is likely to remain the theme for at least the next quarter if not also Q2.Russia and Ukraine tensions have pushed the oil price above $90, and financial stocks benefit from higher interest rates. Growth stocks, however, do not benefit from higher interest rates as investors look for businesses with cash. With higher interest rates, future cash flows become less valuable. So of the three names mentioned, Tesla, Rivian (RIVN) or Lucid (LCID), we would not want to currently be long any of them. We expect TSLA to perform best of the three due to its market-leading position and revenue, but this sector is out of favour and likely to remain so.## Tesla Stock NewsThe latest data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) confirms what we saw from Chinese EV companies earlier. Deliveries for January were down versus December. This is due to the lunar new year in China. Tesla sold 59,845 vehicles in January, down from 70,847 China-made vehicles in December. The Chinese electric vehicle market remains the largest EV market in the world, helped by government incentives and population demand.[',\n",

He usually always just wore long johns and then jeans on top, BUT jeans aren\\'t waterproof! So, I just ordered these and showed him when they arrived. He uses them everyday in the morning to go feed our cows in the snow, wind, rain, anything. He says they are super comfortable, moves with him when he is getting off and on the tractor and hay wagon. They have belt loop holes, which he loves, so he just wears his belt with them. I ordered him the 34x34 and he is 5\\'8\\'\\' and 200lbs or less and they fit perfectly. The bottoms of the pants aren\\'t the widest, but he sticks them inside his insulated rubber boots so they don\\'t need to go over his boot, yet they probably could.

Initial thoughts and a note on sizingReviewed in the United States on December 12, 2021Size: 32W x 30LStyle: SoftshellColor: BlackVerified PurchaseI\\'ve been looking for a nice pair of waterproof pants for when the snow season hits, and for the price, I\\'m very pleased with these TSLA Men\\'s Snow/Waterproof pants. I was considering spending easily double on bigger name brands (North Face, Columbia, Patagonia, etc). I\\'m glad I didn\\'t go that route and found these instead.A note on sizing - For reference, I\\'m 5\\'10\", 155lbs and wear a 30/30 in all my normal pants/jeans/bottoms/etc and have for many years. Initially I bought a size \\'Small\\' from the somewhat confusing sizing options drop-down menu, given another review that suggested they might fit. Upon receiving them, they were just a hair too slim in the waist even with the slight elasticity, so I returned them and ordered a specific size of \\'32/30\\', which arrived and fits great. They are slightly bit roomier in the waist, but I\\'d prefer that as I plan to wear under layers for snow days (I bet size 30/30 would\\'ve been bang-on). Quality and construction seem great, waterproofness tested and is as advertised, zipper pulls feel a little delicate — but I\\'m not the type to tug at things haphazardly, so they should last me fine.Related, I\\'ve also purchased the TSLA matching snow jacket, and aside from my order of that not coming with the advertised velcro attachable hood (which their customer support refunded me for promptly after I provided photos), it too is fantastic, well made, and very warm.Keep it up TSLA, I\\'ll be recommending your products to my family and friends.Read more2 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tJason4.0 out of 5 stars Size close to True, Mostly water repellent, WarmReviewed in the United States on February 7, 2021Size: XX-LargeStyle: SoftshellColor: GreyVerified PurchaseI ordered an XXL and XL as reviews said they run a little small. I\\'m between a 34/36 waist and 30/32 inseam depending on cut and brand. I found the XXL too big, and the XL slightly big, although they were both similar. I will order a large and see how it compares, but will def return the XXL. I will also rivet in a few button hooks for using with suspenders instead of a belt, which I feel causes the waist to pleat. I wore the XLs out on a snowshoe trek, and there was only minimal moisture absorbed, even after sitting on a snowbank for 45min for a lunch break. With a thin base layer, I stayed warm all day and comfortable indoors for a couple of hours at dinner. Will wash in Nikwax to enhance water resistance. Will surely wear again.2 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tRock W.5.0 out of 5 stars Different than traditional snow pantsReviewed in the United States on January 26, 2022Verified PurchaseThese are nice, the quality is great, all the pockets have zippers. Soft fleece on the inside. I can see what some people are saying that the crotch area feels tightish, but it’s a different style than snow pants so if you’re expecting the feeling you get with snow pants you won’t. Once you start moving your legs around you notice how stretchy they are and the crotch area doesn’t seem as tight. I got a 32-32 (I’m 6’ 1” | 175 lbs.) and they fit perfect. I’m actually surprised how nicely these fit. They even feel great with butt padding tights underneath. One thing I will say is they will not fit over your boots.

       " 'Listen up Tards, Everyone knows interest rate hikes are right around the corner. .25% or .5% hike next month isn\\'t going to matter in the long run. The market seems to be expecting interest rates to finish the year somewhere between 1-2%, with another couple of rate hikes in 2023. It\\'s no secret the Fed will have trouble hitting 3% much less 4% interest rates before the start of 2024, and ultimately I don\\'t think that will happen. The Fed can\\'t finance it\\'s 30Trilly debt with interest rates that high. If so, we would go full Volcker and have positive real interest rates, but cmon now let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves. With that out of the way, we are also starting to see a flattening of the yield curve. That coupled with the consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan coming in at 61.7 instead of the expected 67.5, the lowest it\\'s been in 11yrs it\\'s not looking great. If inflation eats away at your salary that can\\'t outpace inflation you will end up buying less, and that\\'s what we\\'re starting to see. This points us towards a looming recession around the corner. While no one including me knows how long that will last, the Fed won\\'t want to go into it with near-zero interest rates. Therefore we are going to get the interest rate hike we expect, but sometime in the next 12-18 months, the Fed will have no choice but to lower them again and put the market and economy back on crack. Expect this dip to be short, and don\\'t be the Tard who sat on the sidelines during March of 2022. Get your good deals in while they last. Now one might ask \"what\\'s the best way to invest during a high inflationary period?\" Great question. Let\\'s ask the professional Tard who does this for a living: Buffet. He describes companies that generate large cash flows, deep moats, have pricing power over their competitors, and software companies that don\\'t require a lot of upfront capital to generate profits. Enter Tesla... Let\\'s go back to inflation real quick and how auto fits into that. Used auto prices are up abt 40%ish yoy and new cars are still up in price and don\\'t show any signs of coming back down soon. On top of that gas prices are through the roof. Month over month consumers have to do more and more mental gymanistics to go out and buy an ICE vehicle. Through this mess Tesla emerges with no demand problem in site, while they continue to outpace their own 50% delivery growth comfortably. Tesla grew deliveries 80something% yoy in the midst of a chip shortage that still did affect them. With the chip shortage hoepfully subsiding later this year, how will that afffect Tesla? On top of all this they increased their gross margins throughout last year. This is the pricing power you want a company to have in a high inflationary environment. Also, now for the most devisive part sorounding Tesla: fsd beta. While I don\\'t think beta will be necarsily better than a human by the end of the year, I think were a lot closer than most expect. Fsd beta revenue will be pure profit to Tesla\\'s bototm line, which is what you want during inflation. BuT tEsLa\\'S pE iS 180! Well I believe Tesla will prob do abt 12$ in eps this year at a minimum which equates to a PE ratio a little over 70 at todays price. How does that number change when a comapny continues to grow it\\'s earnigns at 50+% a year? Tesla is dirt cheap if your investing horizon is longer than 5yrs. tldr: Fed can\\'t raise rates for long with a recession aroudn the corner, and with inflation showing no signs of slowing you must invest in productive companies with strong balance sheets, pricing power, and deep moats.

Slightly heavier than just a regular spandex/poly shirtReviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019Verified PurchaseGreat quality, great price. Slightly heavier than just a regular spandex/poly shirt-rash guard. One layer but inside is like very lightweight fleece, outside smooth. 90% polyester/10% polyurathane, it should be extremely durable and not loose it’s elasticity light spandex/lycra will.About the fit: ignore all those reviews saying order up X sizes if you’re.... That’s someone else’s idea of correct fit; great for them, maybe not for you. Here’s some stuff that might help:It’s a compression shirt, US sized correctly for a compression shirt. e.g. A typical medium t shirt is a little tight on me, this is a second skin in medium.The fit is a little tighter than Tesla’s rash guard shirts, if you have one of those.Athletic cut: It tapers down through the torso.I wear a 16x34-35 dress shirt, 42 suit jacket. For this in M sleeves are just right, neck is not restrictive, everything else is tight. Perfect for a base layer. Very pleased.I’m updating this just because I wish they had one other option. I also have this shirt in the standard, non-thermal. I wish they made a combo for cold weather running. The full fleece gets a little hot. What I’d like to have is thermal sleeves on a non-thermal body.

This product is supposed to fit very tight for the compression quality to work. I bought a size bigger and regretted it. I am 6\\'2\" 226 lbs, 46 inch chest, 17 inch neck and 34-35 inch arm length. You could say I have a large build with a little belly. I should have just bought the lg but instead bought the XL. The belly isn\\'t as tight as I would like it to be in the XL. I felt like the rest fitted like a regular long sleeved shirt that\\'s just a little fitted and no compression in the belly. Don\\'t get me wrong this is a great shirt that wicks away the sweat and keeps you warm. The design also looks great.21 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tdinosnake3.0 out of 5 stars Sized too large if you\\'re used to actual compression, buy 1 size smallerReviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020Verified PurchaseNot sure if anyone else actually knows what \"compression shirt\" means as they send in reviews. \\'Very revealing\\', \\' very snug\\', etc. \"Compression\" means that if you\\'re NOT getting \"revealing\" then it isn\\'t compressing; if you get a smooth line of profile in the cloth, rather than it clinging to your form, then it ISN\\'T compressing. All those photos showing smooth draping fabric have it wrong!I say this because, for REAL compression, the sizing chart is dead wrong. With an actually-measured chest of 39.5, and a waist of 31, I should wear the Medium according to the chart. The Medium fit like a t-shirt - no compression. Just like the people in the photos.Returned them all for a Small. Actual compression.These are not t-shirts.

At one point it started to rain, a layer of fog fell down on the mountain, and the weather dropped, but I never felt cold. This base layer kept me warm, comfortable, and generally pretty dry. I would 100% recommend this base layer to anyone who\\'s looking for an inexpensive alternative to what Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour offer. So if you\\'re looking for base layer for the fall or winter, you can grab this one and it should do the trick.For reference on size: I\\'m 5\\'4\" and weigh about 135-140lbs. I purchased the S, and it fits about right. The stitching or direction of the material/fabric around the arms does tends to feel a bit tight, as if it\\'s pulling on the rest of the shirt.

The quality and warmth is nice, but it is much smaller and tighter than a different Tesla cold weather compression base layer that I ordered of the same size (large). The other one had regular shoulders and a different model number, but was the same material. It was tight too, but this particular shirt is made for more of an athletic build I think. It is about the same across the chest as the other Tesla, but narrows a lot more in the body. I am a 5\\'4\" woman of about 125 lbs, and it is tight on me. Of course, it stretches out to whatever you need it to be, but be aware of how tight it is. My husband is 5\\'9\" and about 173 lbs, and I doubt that he will end up wearing it much.I want to add one more thing.

We will answer once and for all what is the fair value of TSLA. (Sources are in the reply to the post, since some links seem to be triggering auto-remove)Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)Let\\'s start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or (sigh...) twitter. It goes like this:* Tesla\\'s car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source is Technoking himself \\\\[1\\\\].* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Common cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien dreadnought?* Tesla is a *tech company*. They will generate enormous revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).* According to some, Tesla is... ETF \\\\[2\\\\]?* Tesla sexbot. Enough said.Let\\'s start with an automotive sales part:* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing cheaper models. According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current ASP is $50.7K, derived from dividing auto revenue excl. regulatory credits by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be $66.2K (50.7 x 1.03\\\\^9)* With net margins of 13% that would result in 66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B of net income.* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to the automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive Tesla PE of 15.* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) 172B x 15 = 2.58T. That can\\'t be right! An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\\\\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (\\\\~twice the industry average) will only triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3\\'s)?* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\\\\^9 = 1.4T, so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing in SPY?* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\\\\^(1/9) = 1.125 or 12.5% annually. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.But a careful observer would remind me that we are talking about Tech company and not an Auto company. But before we go there... let\\'s discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.Chapter 2. Automotive market or \"bulls are fukd\".Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me personally).No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 \\\\[3\\\\]. Citation: \"... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ...\". From this we can assume EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.* China plans to transition 40% of vehicles sales to so-called \"New Energy vehicles\" by 2030 (that include all plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) \\\\[4\\\\] . So we take EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids) \\\\[5\\\\], i.e. 50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars, as can be seen from the figure below \\\\[6\\\\]. Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn\\'t locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make a rather bullish assumption of 20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world by 2030.[Map of proposed plans for phasing-out of fossil-fuel vehicles]( automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows \\\\[7\\\\]: China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on the regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = 0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets \\\\[8\\\\] global automotive sales should reach 122.8M units by 2030. Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we arrive at 62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030. It is important to understand that this is a bullish estimate rather than the base. First of all, we applied a rather rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales in the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in lower global EV sales by 2030 than what we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 \\\\[9\\\\].Chapter 3. Tesla\\'s market share.Figure below depicts how EV sales looked so far according to ev-volumes research firm:[Global annual EV sales from 2012 to 2021]( is easy to estimate Tesla\\'s market share from this graph:* 2018: 245K / 2082K = 11.8%* 2019: 367K / 2276K = 16.2%* 2020: 500K / 3240K = 15.4%* 2021: 936K / 6750K = 13.9%Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla\\'s market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make any conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla\\'s market share and a ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla currently has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y\\'s original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. See below Model S/X annual sales for years 2017 to 2021.[Model S\\\\/X sales by year]( is easy to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $90K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $90K and not 7-year old used one for the price of $35K.So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can also be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.Despite all that, let\\'s consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we arrive at 8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030. This is whopping 56.5% lower than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030. An annual return of 2.5% if you invest at current prices.Chapter 4. ASP - \"Get rich or die trying\"Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively \\\\[10\\\\]. It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota Motor corp. as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).According to the latest Toyota Financial report \\\\[11\\\\] (Q1-Q3 combined) ASP of a Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also include financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it is a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, Tesla\\'s 2030 ASP is $49.5K (=38K x 1.03\\\\^9) or 25% lower than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.Deducting these extra 25% results in TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B, or -0.7% annual return if you invest today. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.Margins.One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter pollsWhen we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B, and to my understanding that might not even include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in)[Tesla\\'s outstanding shares over the lifetime of the company]( to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average annual share dilution of 1.1% \\\\[12\\\\]. Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings total share dilution to 10.3% (1.011\\\\^9).On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to receive obnoxious bonus compensations, he is quite open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares, as it increases the supply on the open market. But it shouldn\\'t play a role *in theory* for the long term.The results:If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:* our estimated target for market cap of 840B USD,* and take into account bullish 10% share dilutionTesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\\\\^9 / (1.103) = 323B USD todayOr with the current number of outstanding shares, stock price should not exceed : 323B / 1.123B = 287 USDFor Tesla bulls: before you say it\\'s outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. All that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn\\'t even account for.Chapter X. Other product lines of Tesla:As for the other product lines, it\\'s difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity:[Solar City \\\\/ Tesla solar power deployed by quarter]( 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing:[Annual Tesla\\'s solar and storage deployed]( it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin[Tesla\\'s gross margins from the latest financial report]( a company calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it; whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that all affect Operating margins.The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world \\\\[13\\\\] have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla\\'s valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.Chapter Hype: Fraud Self DrivingThis one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*Since Tesla doesn\\'t share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon\\'s statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa\\'s challenges and even before.But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000 miles in 2019 \\\\[14\\\\]. For the sake of the argument, let\\'s say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\\\\*ck it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with an average of 0.28 - 1.4 lethal accidents per year. That\\'s where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that\\'s where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it\\'s one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla fights against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.Chapter Hype: To be continued...I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from the semiconductors perspectives (given Tesla\\'s ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.Chapter History.A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to is *Cisco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was the stonk in 2000. Cisco actually was the World\\'s biggest company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now \\\\[15\\\\], SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today\\'s dollars.And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance,a bloomberg article claimed \\\\[16\\\\] claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another nice fella from Credit Suisse \\\\[17\\\\] believed Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?[CSCO stock price over the lifetime]( the chart above you see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven\\'t recovered to it\\'s ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Now Cisco is the real solid company with current valuation of 225B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.It doesn\\'t really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?ConclusionMy conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself is responsible for you financial decisions. Personally, I am shorting.My positions: 25x TSLA Jan 20 \\'23 250P, 1x Mar25 750/700 Bear Put, 1x May 650/600 Bear PutBulls, good luck on your trip to the moon. My fellow Bears, see you in fucking Valhalla!P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz \"announced\" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn\\'t we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA hodlers? khm....',\n",

       " '\\tTesla will not be first to commercialize ride-hailing network, says BernsteinBernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi says that given that Tesla is not currently working on developing a $25K/lower price vehicle, the importance of Autonomy/Full Self Driving to the Tesla investment thesis is \"arguably more relevant than ever.\" The analyst believes Tesla \"will NOT be the first company to commercialize a ride-hailing network,\" in large part because it is not using a geofenced approach, which will likely be a key parameter of early stage robotaxi operations. FSD will likely continue to take longer to deliver than Tesla believes, Sacconaghi argues. Industry executives/pundits believe that Level 5 autonomy is highly unlikely over the next few years, primarily due to the very long tail of edge cases, he adds. The analyst also believes that the regulatory hurdle is very high. Sacconaghi has an Underperform rating and a price target of $300 on the shares.',\n",

Amazing!Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2017Verified PurchaseSpeaking for the overweight men out there than need a good thermal underwear, I’ve tried many products but this one is finally here for us. In a world for slim fit men, this company caters to the overweight oversized men’s needs. I myself am 5’6”, weight 280lbs, and have a very large butt. I have never been able to find a product to fit me. I do a lot of walking and trying to be active, so I have been looking for underwear that won’t ride up and cause soars on my thighs. This product fits excellent in my 3XL size I bought. When it arrived I was sad because it looks far to small, but it ended up fitting great without stretching out of proportion and gives all the comfort and needs that I required. These are great for daily wear, excercize, and for motorcycles, hunting, hiking, camping, and any other needs. I am so happy with these. The only think I could say negative, is I wish the butt area was larger, but as I have a much larger bottom than others, I can’t really complain as they still fit and work. Look no further, and purchase these above others. Many others I bought and tried failed and won’t fit. My fellow overweight friends, these are the thermal long underwear you have been looking for. I will get more. I purchased the Black on Black ones, but I plan on getting different colors and more. Highly recommended!!345 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tSavvy?4.0 out of 5 stars Don\\'t size upReviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020Verified PurchaseThese are great for what they are. DON\\'T ORDER A SIZE UP. I\\'m thinking that most of the reviewers who say size up have never worn leggings or compression before (maybe only long John\\'s?) and so don\\'t know how they are supposed to fit (aka want them loose).I am 5\\'11\" and about 178lbs, athletic build. I should have ordered a medium but got a large. The length is really good, and there is a lot of room up front, which makes me wonder how a woman could wear these. In fact, they have the most room there of any leggings I\\'ve ever worn.All that said they are suuuper comfy. Especially when it\\'s cold. I wear these alone with no shorts over them (hate that look). If you work your legs and are a guy, be proud brother. Don\\'t hide those beauties. We work hard for them.Anyway, for as cheap as they are, I won\\'t return them,but I might order some mediums to see how it goes. Again, for the way they are supposed to fit, I recommend you order your normal size.56 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tdngi. inc5.0 out of 5 stars Order true sizeReviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020Size: X-LargeColor: Pocket BlackVerified PurchaseJust got them in, they feel very comfortable, great no chafe no pull, but not compressionable enough I did go up a size so I would definitely order again but stick to a large this purchase was an extra large and in one of the pictures you can see creases on my backside.

If you want compression go Large if you want comfortable lounge go extra large by the way I\\'m 5\\'7\" a size 34 in pants 32 actual waist with a muscle build if that helps.

I was looking for thermal wear so I could continue running outside in the cold weather. I got them today in time to test them out for today’s run.My first concern was if I ordered the right size. I followed the size chart for them & read other reviews. They fit like a glove. They feel so much better than regular sweat pants I’ve been wearing. They stay in place, they don’t bunch up & they fit from my waist to the top of my shoes.My second concern was will they keep me warm. When I took them out of the package I started laughing thinking these are never going to keep me warm. When I put them on & walked out the door the initial blast of cold air made me feel like I may have waisted my money, I was wrong. After that first initial feeling once I got started running the did an excellent job of keeping me warm,Absolutely no complaints! I guess when I took them out of the package I was expecting a lil more fleece on the inside, no need for it. These worked 100% in the 34° damp cool Iowa weather today.I love the fit,feel & warmth of these. I’ll probably be ordering more soon!9 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tP ♥️ A Gibbs5.0 out of 5 stars Pant size 32-30 150 lb 5\\'7, medium perfect glove fit.Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021Verified PurchaseOh my gosh these things are so comfortable I\\'m definitely buying more. As stated in the title I am 5\\'7 150 lb with a pant size of 32-30.These thermal pants fit like a glove, Amazon suggested either a medium or a large, I bought a large first and it fit but was loose around different parts of my legs, I sent it back and got a medium now they fit like a glove without squeezing the life out of my legs and waist, it\\'s absolutely perfect! They have just the right amount of fleece to not feel like plastic, like the alleged sweat absorbing non-fleece compression pants. These will work absolutely perfect and just about any temperature below 70° and down to 30. When it gets to 30 and below I have pants that are lined with thicker fleece. My work involves hefty lifting and long hours wheeling grocery product into convenience stores. For those who may know McLean company that is my line of work, truck driver, delivery driver. I plan to use these for my yoga classes as well as they fit so well and are as comfy as my fleece PJs. They\\'re nice and stretchy and as I tug on them and release they snap back into place with a medium fit, absolutely perfect. These pants do not have separate pouch support so you will need to wear your own pouch support underwear for those men who are hung like myself. I plan to buy other compression pants for this purpose, deliberately designed around hung men. I personally prefer to wear fleece lined compression pants designed around men who are hung and wear them without underwear cuz it\\'s more comfortable and less restriction on my waist.But as for these pants they fit so well and are so comfortable I will gladly wear them with my hung underwear and still be just as comfortable.Read more4 people found this helpfulHelpful### [Buy Now From Amazon!](',\n",

My hubby loves them!Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019Color: Thermal Fleece Jet BlackSize: X-LargeVerified PurchaseGoodbye old fashioned waffle type long johns! I bought these for my husband to wear to work. He works 12-hour shifts in all elements... So with the cold coming I thought he could use these. Now that we\\'ve received them and he\\'s put them on ( and of course I tried them on too haha ) I\\'m wondering why they didn\\'t make them like this all along. They fit perfectly to his body and don\\'t ride up his butt crack and he says it\\'s important to put in the review that it doesn\\'t pinch your balls either. I was more worried about the crotch sliding down in between his thighs but that doesn\\'t happen either, everything stays put all day. It isn\\'t too tight in the neck and it doesn\\'t irritate his underarms which we were a little afraid of because he has sensitive skin. We\\'ve had them now a little less than a week and he won\\'t even take them off for me to wash them. I\\'m going to have to sneak in the laundry on his day off and do it that\\'s how much he loves these second skin like thermals. I would not advise putting these in the dryer though. I can imagine they would fit a small child after that. I could be wrong but it\\'s not worth chancing. For reference he is 6.5 tall, 175 lbs. XL was perfect.

I\\'m not trying them on now (it\\'s August), but at first glance, they appear soft, comfortable and as if they will fit snug-ly (which is what you want with thermal underwear). The waist on the pants is embarrassingly bad (a thin piece of elastic sewn inside of the material); less substantial than even a men\\'s pair of briefs and inferior to what you would find on your typical thermal underwear.There is nothing on the tag to indicate they are \"fleece lined.\" My tag says \"Overheat Hyper-dri\" and notes these as being workout material for the winter (I have zero intention of working out in these). For this reason, I\\'ve given a 3 star rating for the time being. If I find these keep me warm during the winter (or not), I will update my review accordingly.Peace.UPDATE: I\\'ve worn these twice and was very impressed with them as far as comfort is concerned. Super comfortable and way more forgiving and stretchy than typical thermals. I can feel that the inside is different, but as at least one other reviewer mentioned, they feel sort of odd (cold?) when you first put them on (because they are designed to keep you from over-heating?). I was pretty comfortable in 50\\'s/20 mph winds while wearing under khakis and a shirt. They\\'ll help as a layer in lower temperatures with typical winter clothing. 4 stars (would give 5 if waist band was substantial and if they were warmer).Peace.Read more84 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tJames H.4.0 out of 5 stars It\\'s a great cheap alternative.Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2019Color: Thermal Fleece WhiteSize: MediumVerified PurchaseOh well, submitting a picture erased a three-paragraph review that\\'s never happening again.

They are perfect for my needs. I’m older. I’ve started a walking regiment to loose wait. I like to be prepared. I wasn’t the first time I went out with the north wind blasting away at me. I did my research. These were my choice. They are soft against your skin. They lay on you not cling to you. They move with you and haven’t ridden up or bunched up on me. The coolest part. When you put them on they feel cool on your skin. When I say cool I mean temperature wise. When you first walk outside they even feel cooler. Am I concerned? Yes at first. But then I started walking. The wind was blowing 20 mph it was misting rain. I am wearing this base layer a pair of cotton warmups and an mesh lined wind suit. The story goes. 1/2 mile in. I am cool but not cold. The wind is still not fun. 1 1/2 miles in. I’m hot. I’m starting to sweat. No wait that’s good. 2 1/2 miles in. I am removing my cotton mid layer. I have just a little less than a mile to go. The wind is a blessing. Synopsis. Yes these are the perfect base layer. If you want to go ice fishing with this base layer and jeans, guess what? You will be cold. Not because of this product though. Yes I bought two pair. One in large and one in X-large. Right now I love the X-large. 5’5” 170 lbs. Roomy and comfortable. My goal is 150. The large. Will be perfect. Would I buy again?

I love everything about this brand. My second favorite is Nike, but Nike lacks a true pouch with their products. These have an ergonomic fit for the boys, and are very comfortable. The waistline fits good, and will not be sticking out over my pants. Most long underwear seems to reach my belly button. They are reasonably warm, and as it hasn\\'t dropped below freezing the real test for that is yet to come. I could have another inch or so to my waist and they would still fit, although compression would increase. If you are up to a 32\" waist get medium, any bigger would be large. I may have to order a third set, I already have white and dark grey. This brand really is awesome on the fit and quality of their products. Thanks Tesla, your brand fits me.

They are made from thin polyester, and if you hold them up to the light you can see through them! I have bought TSLA products before, and they are better than this.

The only reason I didn’t give them 5 stars is that they are a little tight. I’m a runner and so maybe my quads are a little thicker than normal but my waist is about a 29 and fit my waist quite snug. However, they can be a little harder to get on as they are very tight around my quads. Perhaps I should have ordered a medium which would normally be a little big but in this case they probably would have for a tad bit better.5 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tMike3.0 out of 5 stars Very thin, not \"fleece lined\"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2022Color: Thermal Fly-front 2p Navy/ GalaxySize: X-LargeVerified PurchaseThese leggings are soft and comfy, but far thinner than I was expecting.

Slightly heavier than just a regular spandex/poly shirtReviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019Verified PurchaseGreat quality, great price. Slightly heavier than just a regular spandex/poly shirt-rash guard. One layer but inside is like very lightweight fleece, outside smooth. 90% polyester/10% polyurathane, it should be extremely durable and not loose it’s elasticity light spandex/lycra will.About the fit: ignore all those reviews saying order up X sizes if you’re.... That’s someone else’s idea of correct fit; great for them, maybe not for you. Here’s some stuff that might help:It’s a compression shirt, US sized correctly for a compression shirt. e.g. A typical medium t shirt is a little tight on me, this is a second skin in medium.The fit is a little tighter than Tesla’s rash guard shirts, if you have one of those.Athletic cut: It tapers down through the torso.I wear a 16x34-35 dress shirt, 42 suit jacket. For this in M sleeves are just right, neck is not restrictive, everything else is tight. Perfect for a base layer. Very pleased.I’m updating this just because I wish they had one other option. I also have this shirt in the standard, non-thermal. I wish they made a combo for cold weather running. The full fleece gets a little hot. What I’d like to have is thermal sleeves on a non-thermal body.

This product is supposed to fit very tight for the compression quality to work. I bought a size bigger and regretted it. I am 6\\'2\" 226 lbs, 46 inch chest, 17 inch neck and 34-35 inch arm length. You could say I have a large build with a little belly. I should have just bought the lg but instead bought the XL. The belly isn\\'t as tight as I would like it to be in the XL. I felt like the rest fitted like a regular long sleeved shirt that\\'s just a little fitted and no compression in the belly. Don\\'t get me wrong this is a great shirt that wicks away the sweat and keeps you warm. The design also looks great.21 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tdinosnake3.0 out of 5 stars Sized too large if you\\'re used to actual compression, buy 1 size smallerReviewed in the United States on December 15, 2020Verified PurchaseNot sure if anyone else actually knows what \"compression shirt\" means as they send in reviews. \\'Very revealing\\', \\' very snug\\', etc. \"Compression\" means that if you\\'re NOT getting \"revealing\" then it isn\\'t compressing; if you get a smooth line of profile in the cloth, rather than it clinging to your form, then it ISN\\'T compressing. All those photos showing smooth draping fabric have it wrong!I say this because, for REAL compression, the sizing chart is dead wrong. With an actually-measured chest of 39.5, and a waist of 31, I should wear the Medium according to the chart. The Medium fit like a t-shirt - no compression. Just like the people in the photos.Returned them all for a Small. Actual compression.These are not t-shirts.

At one point it started to rain, a layer of fog fell down on the mountain, and the weather dropped, but I never felt cold. This base layer kept me warm, comfortable, and generally pretty dry. I would 100% recommend this base layer to anyone who\\'s looking for an inexpensive alternative to what Nike, Adidas, or Under Armour offer. So if you\\'re looking for base layer for the fall or winter, you can grab this one and it should do the trick.For reference on size: I\\'m 5\\'4\" and weigh about 135-140lbs. I purchased the S, and it fits about right. The stitching or direction of the material/fabric around the arms does tends to feel a bit tight, as if it\\'s pulling on the rest of the shirt.

Fortier4.0 out of 5 stars Nice shirt, but runs smallReviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017Verified PurchaseI ordered the TM-R34-XB for my husband. The quality and warmth is nice, but it is much smaller and tighter than a different Tesla cold weather compression base layer that I ordered of the same size (large). The other one had regular shoulders and a different model number, but was the same material. It was tight too, but this particular shirt is made for more of an athletic build I think. It is about the same across the chest as the other Tesla, but narrows a lot more in the body. I am a 5\\'4\" woman of about 125 lbs, and it is tight on me. Of course, it stretches out to whatever you need it to be, but be aware of how tight it is.

       " 'This is the second update to my previous post. I have added two more sections. Debt and EV strategy  Debt Ford debt on their balance sheet that appears under long term debt heading is actually “NOT DEBT” that huge debt figure is the lending arm of Ford which essentially means:1.  Ford lends people to buy cars and people pay them interest and principal over period of agreed terms. 2.  This debt is the same as banks asset where in a bank makes money on interest payments Therefore, Debt in their balance sheet is long terms loans that ford made, and best part is in the high interest rate environment Ford is going to make more money in interest payments more than ever!! EV StrategyFord Ev strategy is fierce and aggressive. Jim Farley understands that he needs to beat Tesla no matter what. He poached the best people from Tesla who have spent over a decade in tesla to ensure that Ford designs and builds better ev cars.  He is partnering with chip manufacturing firm Global foundries to get a better deal on chips. Surprisingly ford has partnered with Google in lot of skill building projects. It is possible that we may see a future partnership between google and ford for their EV software. Jim knows that they need a software partner to optimize their designs and builds. Previous Post ·  Product LineTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. ·  MarginsTesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. ·  Valuation & Market Share The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s ·  MoatTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. ·  MarketingTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!·  High Interest rate Environment We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. ·  TeamLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer.',\n",

       " \"I've updated my valuation model since the new announcement that all focus will be on FSD. My assumption is that the current line-up will continue to be produced and sold to consumers for the foreseeable timeframe, though the Model 2 will not be a consumer vehicle.When FSD is solved and legislation is in place all added production capacity will be directed towards a dedicated FSD robotaxi. The production cost is \\\\~25K, though the cost of the vehicle is negligible in this model.Each robotaxi will on average replace 5 other cars, and each passenger is on average willing to pay $300 per month. (This figure is about the cost of owning a car: including fuel, maintenance, parking, insurance, value loss et cetera - a family with 2-3 cars will get rid of one of them and use a robotaxi instead. The figure also includes software subscriptions, entertainment et cetera).I didn’t account for electricity, maintenance, and reconditioning since these are small figures compared to the overall incomes.A part of the S3XYCT that is already on the road will be used as Robotaxis (though privately owned, hence profits will be shared). All Model 2 will be owned by Tesla hence all the profit ends up there.NOTE: do not pay too much attention to the years before \\\\~2026, the important thing is what happens around 2030The amount of Robotaxis is the accumulated number of Model 2 that has been made. The figures become nutty quite fast. Please provide feedback on my assumptions & how to improve the model!\",\n",

For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. Introduction I know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let’s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).Before we go comparing apples to oranges I’d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.Apple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won’t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won’t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [ Competition is ComingIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [ We can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they’d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven’t perfected a single one yet (see Chevy Bolt). In 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that “They’re still catching up with the first iPhone we’ve moved beyond that”. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases.

       " \"Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they’re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. Introduction I know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let’s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).Before we go comparing apples to oranges I’d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.Apple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won’t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won’t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [ Competition is ComingIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [ We can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they’d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins.

Every day I used these pants, I returned to my hotel room with Tesla pants and everything underneath them completely soaking wet. This included anything that was in the pants pockets (money, ski maps, and ID/password) being SOAKING WET. I am not sure if they are not water proof or if they have very poor ventilation. Regardless, very bad experience as it is not fun to be skiing in wet pants all day long. Used a different pair of pants of a different brand after few days and was back to dry pants, as it should be for skiing pants. Also, they are very wide, definitely not a “slim fit”.

       " 'Product LineTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. MarginsTesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. Valuation & Market Share The most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! Tesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s ·MoatTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. MarketingTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!! High Interest rate Environment We are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. ·TeamLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades.

I\\'m 5\\'8 135 lbs and I usually wear a 4-6 pants. A size small fit perfectly- fitted high waist, stretchy in the hips and knees, and long enough to cover the tops of my feet. I have trouble finding snowpants because my hips are a little wide, and most other pants don\\'t stretch. They definitely fit true to size, if you size by your measurements. For reference: my waist is a 27-28\" and my hips are 39\".These pants are very warm and tuck nicely into ski/snow boots. I was able to wear them with a base layer and go skiing when the temperature was in the teens. The only downside for these pants is that they are not fully waterproof.

To prepare for the extreme weather, I ordered the TSLA Snow Cargo pants (xkb92), after diligently reading dozens of reviews. As I am 5\\'2\" and 114lbs, I ordered the \"Small/Short\" option. The length was good for me, and the waist size worked, whether I was wearing them alone or with 1 or 2 layers underneath them. They passed my waterproofing sink-test. The TSLA Snow Cargo have 4 well placed pockets; these included 2 cargo pockets on my legs, which my phone fit in, and 2 zippered hip pockets that held keys, a small map, and lip balm(they could have held more). Make sure you choose the \"Snow Cargo\" pants, as the other option has only the 2 zippered hip pockets.The TSLAs have external Velcro waist tabs to help cinch it in, and if needed, there are also belt loops present.The real test: I took ski lessons, and the temperature was anywhere between 9°F and 27°F throughout the week. I wore a base-layer of polyester/nylon/Lycra tights with ski socks (part woolen) pulled up over them. Second layer was a pair of long cotton/Lycra yoga pants, then my TSLAs on top. It was perfect. I felt no chill, and no wind on my legs. One day, I wore only my base-layer tights with my snow pants over them to walk into town, and I was still comfortable. There was one ski day where I ended up sliding in the snow a few times, and I found that a little bit of snow must have gotten into the cargo pocket (it is only secured by Velcro), because I found some water droplets on the ziplock bag that I kept my phone in - but I had anticipated this, hence the ziplock.All in all, these are great snow pants. Plenty of pockets, warm (when worn with the correct under layers), comfortable, and affordable. I may never go skiing again, but I will bring these pants with me the next time I go to a truly cold destination. I definitely recommend these pants. They were a good buy.Read more62 people found this helpfulHelpful\\tKindle Customer3.0 out of 5 stars Runs small so maybe order a size larger than usualReviewed in the United States on March 16, 2019Verified PurchaseI can\\'t give these pants a 5 star because I didn\\'t get to actually use them.

I ordered a medium in different brands as well and they all fit fine...so I had to assume these run small in comparison these were too tight in the waist and hip and I couldn\\'t bend over...actually popped the clasp and zipper open when I tried to bend...too tight. So I would suggest ordering one size larger...no way I could even fit long underwear or leggings/yoga pants under these for skiing.

I am, however, a bit heavy around the waist, size 44\", I usually wear a large or size 12 in pants. Using the chart I decided I would need an XLarge to be safe, the waist was too small for me (about 1.5\"). The length was too long, but with the snow boots on I am sure it would have worked.

See [here]( and [here](  As title says, I think this is a bad idea.  From an Investor Standpoint and a Philosophical Standpoint.  Philosophy Standpoint  There is no world where TSLA getting pulled into the spotlight is good.  The best case scenario is they get the acknowledgement people are looking for and then that is used to guilt them into becoming effectively a branch of the government.  Guarantee you if this administration acknowledges TSLA, that speech would end with \"and it is TSLA\\'s duty to share and help our Union Autoworkers into the future blah blah blah\".  That\\'s the best case.The worse case, and more likely imo, is this pressure will cause this administration to double down on anti TSLA sentiment, maybe even take more direct measures to counter TSLA\\'s growth.and just to bring this home.  Imagine a world where the administration acknowledges TSLA\\'s lead in earnest, Build Back Better is adjusted to give TSLA advantages for already being all electric, and TSLA simply explodes to 2k because everyone just accepts the status quo.  Yeah I see hell freezing over too.Investor Standpoint  This is easy.  TSLA will have a better rally if all this drama goes quiet.  Let the suckers keep thinking GM and Ford are catching up.  Let this Administration keep pretending.  A stock flies when it surprises people so the longer we keep quiet and let the naysayers live in lala land, the harder the pop when the bread comes out of the oven.In short, I don\\'t think this wave of pressure to thrust TSLA into a political spotlight is a good idea.

       " 'There\\'s so much to cram into this DD/model that I\\'m going to try to keep each point brief.Table of contents:1) First, what are the risks; Quick Notes2) Master equation\\ta) gaap earnings per EV\\t\\ti) model & explanation\\t\\tii) dropping battery costs\\t\\tiii) increase in efficiency of manufacturing/innovation\\t\\tiv) regulator credits will vanish. Tesla is insanely profitable without them.\\tb) EVs delivered\\t\\ti) why competition won\\'t affect Tesla\\'s sales\\tc) P/E ratio\\t\\ti) reasons and justification for a 50 P/E1) I\\'ll start with the risks to my valuation model: In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla\\'s valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.If there\\'s an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. And of course there\\'s the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla\\'s growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.I do \\\\*NOT\\\\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.Quick Note: This model is based \\\\*only\\\\* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we\\'ll see why in my model in section 2ai)Another Note: My model below has a base case (based on 50% YoY growth as Tesla aims for), a bear case (based on 40% YoY growth), and a bull case (based on 60% YoY growth) i.e. in the event that Tesla fails to execute on 50% YoY growth, achieving only 40%, then the bear case shows how the numbers could be affected2) I\\'d like to start with a simple equation, and expand on the details of the equation. This is for year 2027:$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \\\\* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \\\\* 50 P/E = $7.2T market cap or approximately $7000/shareSections 2a, 2b and 2c will be the reasoning behind $12k gaap earnings per ev, 12.1M EVs delivered, and 50 P/E respectively2a) This gaap earnings per EV metric will be the most difficult to explain. I\\'ll start with my model and an explanation2ai) Here\\'s my model: [ non-gaap earnings per EV through 2021 by quarter: $5628, $8060, $8622, $9208Explanation of model: Warning, this is incredibly detailed. I\\'m going to try to keep the explanation as simple as possible, and I\\'m more than happy to answer any questions. Note: I wrote this DD before Q4 earnings came out, and I decided to leave that data point so you can actually see that my prediction was $2.48 non-GAAP earnings (not bad, huh? actual was $2.54)The black numbers are known numbers (from 2020 Q3 to 2021 Q3). The red numbers are unknown, but projected numbers. From known numbers in the ER reports I was able to calculate ASP (average selling price, i.e. total auto revenue/evs delivered), COG per EV (cost of goods per EV, i.e. ASP\\\\*(1- gross margin)), earnings per EV ((non-GAAP EPS\\\\*outstanding shares)/EV delivered), and I was also able to calculate a sort of \"operational/manufacturing cost per EV\" by this equation:ASP - COG per EV - earnings per EV = \"operational\" cost per EVHere\\'s a beautiful illustration of this equation:[ now that we have ASP, COG per EV, earnings per EV, an \"operational\" cost per EV and EVs delievered.. how do I project to get the red numbers? I extrapolated using exponential decay. Based on the rates that ASP, COG per EV and \"operational\" cost per EV were already falling, I took that rate and extrapolated out using an exponential decay model. I also assumed 50% YoY growth in EVs delievred (or 10.66% QoQ compounding). The math for exponential decay was pretty annoying. For anyone interseted, here\\'s the recursive equation: P1 = (P0 - b)\\\\*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. Solving for r gives r = 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b), and so I calculated the average r from the past 4 or 5 iterations to \"use\" the existing rate of decay. Interesting fact, I had to assume some \\'asymptotes\\' for ASP, COG per EV and operational cost per EV, but if you look at my bear, base and bull cases where I\\'ve modified them, you\\'ll see a very little difference in the outlook. The main difference between the base, bull and bear cases is simply growth of sales.So now that I\\'ve extrapolated ASP, COG per EV, \"operational\" cost per EV and EVs delivered.. I can now calculate the project non-GAAP earnings per EV via the equation I used above: earnings per EV = ASP - COG per EV - \"operational\" cost per EVthis one: [ finding earnings per EV, divide by the projected EVs delivered, and then by outstanding shares and you have the non-GAAP EPS estimates.Now for some interesting (but not very pretty) graphs. Again, take 2029 and 2030 with a grain of salt. The S-curve will flattenASP graph:[ per EV graph:[ cost per EV graph:[ is my favorite graph. Through no design of my own, but only from exponential decay extrapolations of other metrics, the non-GAAP earnings per EV graph tops out in 2027 as the year we\\'ll see peak profitability per EV.non-GAAP earnings per EV graph:[ EPS graph:[ so why do we see dropping ASP, COG and operational costs?2aii) Dropping battery costs can be summed up with Wright\\'s Law (Cathie Wood was one of the early TSLA investors that spoke of Wright\\'s Law). Battery costs were as high as $1000/kWh\\\\*\\\\* when Tesla first started building the original Roadster. It has since dropped to $100/kWh, and is expected to drop to $50 or less per kWh.\\\\*\\\\*reference to $1000/kWh: J.B. Straubel, former CTO of Tesla, interview: [ is an excellent reference to declining battery costs as presented by Tony Seba. This presentation was centered around upcoming innovative and disruptive technologies: [ \"Tesla isn\\'t profitable!\" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&D. They\\'ve made their manufacturing more efficient with innovations like the structural battery pack and gigacasting, and with 2 new factories we\\'ll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*. Also, as Tesla opens Austin to serve the east coast US, and Berlin to serve Europe we\\'ll see decreased shipping costs. This will cause the \"operational/manufacturing\" cost per EV to drop.\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*[ regulatory credits were 13% of earnings in 2021 Q3, and 11% of earnings in 2021 Q4. But I\\'m not sure I need to make a bull case for collecting free money.2b) Will Tesla deliver 12M EVs in 2027? This is a fundamental risk for my model, as stated above. If Tesla maintains their 50% YoY sales growth, then they will sell 12M in 2027. We\\'ll see. However, one thing for certain will not change Tesla sales:2bi) Competition. Tesla has \\\\*always\\\\* had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and they have competition today. It\\'s the ICE car, and Tesla is still managing to sell every EV they make. A couple points to make here:I wont get into this point too much. It took Tesla 5 years from their first mass produced EV until they managed positive Free Cash Flow (2013 Model S until 2018). It\\'s not exactly a one-to-one comparison for other companies, but Ford, GM, Rivian, Lucid and others will need at least a couple years to achieve positive free cash flow on the EV segment of their business. But let\\'s say all of them succeed in making a nice commercially viable, and profitable EV..My next point is that the EV market is expanding \\\\*rapidly\\\\*. New EV models will not likely take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. as we\\'ve already witnessed. There\\'s no reason to believe that any new EVs entering the market will take meaningful sales from other EVs instead of gas cars.2c) The P/E ratio will always be a guess. Tesla will be a company with a presence in EV sales, solar and energy storage, large commercial power storage, and potentially FSD software subscriptions and AI driven bots. I believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It\\'s hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but they\\'ve always innovated and come up with new ideas.There is one thing I confident about though; Tesla should \\\\*never\\\\* be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM\\'s P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. Plus legacy automakers are not growing (some have \\\\*lost\\\\* sales for the last 2 years). It took Tesla investing billions over a decade to bring down battery costs, and make the EV commercially viable. Something legacay automakers have never done.Anyway, I hope you guys liked this DD. I\\'ll try to have discussion with you guys in the comments if you\\'d like. If you have a bearish counterpoint, then I\\'m all about discussing it; however, it will help me (and both of us) if you point out which part of this equation it affects:$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \\\\* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \\\\* 50 P/E = $7260/shareso that we can establish the point of disagreement.Thanks for reading!',\n",

For 14 years, your youtube heros before you and your older reddit members played this game and played it well. But today, the game is different. We have the advantage and it reminds me of the heady days of Q3 2021 and S&P inclusion, when the world trembled at the sound of our growth. Well, they will tremble again — at the sound of our EPS. The order is: engage max-q. Comrades, our own shareholders don't know our full potential. They will do everything possible to test us; but they will only test their own embarrassment. We will leave our paper handed shareholders behind, we will pass through the short patrols, past their manupulation, and lay off their largest option ticker, and listen to their futes and such... while we conduct excel tests.

Its simple, 200 EMA acts as a primary support and resistance, 50 next and 10 the last. What I am seeing is TSLA is expected to have a run-up till 900 or so, and then decline till its able to break out of the 200 EMA. I am expecting the 200 EMA to decline to create a tight trading range till there is news to break it. Thoughts?

       " 'Core concept: \"Wealth\" is the ability, to make the systems that one interacts with, work for their benefit.In the days of the cave man, \"the system\" was tribal members and outside nature itself: plants that could be foraged, animals hunted for food and furs, trees that could provide materials for shelter.In modern times, \"the system\" is modern civilization: vast networks of people, machines, and the organizations built upon them.Money in of itself is not wealth.  I believe Elon alluded to this in his most recent interview with Lex Fridman.  A million $ is of no use to someone isolated on an island.  Although money can be a measure of wealth, since it is an accounting tool, the wealth that a sum of money represents can also vary greatly, as money is subject to inflation or even deflation.Shares of stock or other assets are also not necessarily a measure of wealth.  We saw late last year many ordinary people and politicians criticizing Elon for having 200-300 Billion in unrealized capital gains.  This is not the same as having 200-300 Billion in the bank, which in turn is not necessarily the same as having wealth.  When Elon started selling shares, we witnessed the effect on TSLA market price as his shares greatly increase supply on some days.If I have sufficient resources to make the system meet my needs, I feel that I have enough wealth.  Those resources could be anything from tools of the trade to stocks that provide growth or dividends.TSLA provides shareholders the ability to make the system work for our benefit.  We can sell shares, or use shares as collateral for loans, or even sell options against our shares to acquire cash to buy things from the system.  The ability of TSLA to help us work the system will vary from time to time.I began to define wealth less and less in $ terms, and more in terms of what I was able to do in the world, things like: buy a computer, build a business, travel the country, no longer worry about my next rent payment or next week\\'s groceries.It stopped mattering to me whether I had $1M, or $2M, or $10M.  The accounting numbers were ultimately irrelevant.  When I no longer felt restricted in my ability to have the system work for me, I knew I had an incredible amount of wealth.The market value of TSLA goes up and down.  It\\'s ultimately only relevant if it affects my ability to do what I want within the system I inhabit',\n",

       " 'Tesla confirmed to analysts it is currently not working on a lower-priced vehicle and seemed to attribute it in large part to its conviction that the prices of Model 3 and Y can come down considerably further, in order to serve cheaper segment of the market. The current $36k COGS per average TSLA vehicle still includes import taxes to Europe, cross-continent freight and more expensive batteries, and has large room to come down further. But Tesla also reiterated it has a very full plate of important projects this year (including new factories, FSD/autonomy, 4680 cells), which should yield continued strong growth and could start unlocking considerable earnings opportunity from software.Overall, analysts were surprised by the company’s decision to de-prioritize “Model 2”, which was originally scheduled for 2023. But Tesla’s relentless focus on driving down costs through new batteries, product localization, scale and efficiency continues to be in strong evidence quarter after quarter, and should accelerate with this year’s projects. As its efforts continue to bear fruit, analysts believe Tesla should be able to sell much cheaper variants of its existing models profitably, essentially accomplishing the same goals as Model 2, and clearly showcasing Tesla’s cost and technology superiority over all other EV contenders.\\xa0[',\n",
       " \"You can't justify calculating TSLA's future value from the current numbers. You have to be expecting growth in sectors and markets not yet accessed by the company. That is eminently possible but with no information there is no reasonable way to estimate it. Your error bars are too large to create a valid result.You also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.Bottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.That's all the certainty there is. It may go up, but it will certainly go down if it doesn't start reinventing. Getting any number of significant digits on its future value is magical thinking.\",\n",

While the delay to the Cybertruck was widely reported on already (and management has suggested for some time that Model Y is a bigger priority for 2022), the info on the $25K vehicle progress could raise questions on growth in the 2023-2025 timeframe given the large number of vehicles sold in this price band.However, analysts see significant growth ahead with its current models, including as the company drives down cost. Moreover, profits on entry-level vehicles for the entire auto industry have typically been limited, and thus the company's decision to devote its resources first to high-value software and more profitable hardware is reasonable. As Tesla expands its software capabilities, it can better monetize lower cost vehicles (while also helping with its goal to reduce carbon output from transportation).[\",\n",

       " ' TSLA is going to drop more before it rises again. Consider all the usual problems with growth stocks: extremely high PE and forward PE, speculative future income. After so much QE, there is simply so much space for quantitative tightening coming. Yellen has recently reiterated her commitment to controlling inflation to 2% by the end of 2022. While that is optimistic, I think that this reflects the general sentiment at the Fed that something has to be done before the inflation situation deteriorates further. While some of the recent price drops come from fear, the issue with many of these growth stocks comes from contracting PE in the foreseeable 1-2 years. When rates are higher and money is less available, the big players (and hence also the small players) are simply incentivized to hold more cash. This, in turn, will cause prices to drop, and there is a vicious cycle going on here that is the reverse of the virtuous bubble cycle that brought prices so high in the first place. All growth stocks are currently contracting their PE, and we are just getting started. But, TSLA is a particularly egregious case of being big and expensive. AMZN is in second place, and it has had a smaller bubble built during 2021.Neutral case: Quantitative tightening succeeds and stocks trade sideways in 2022, with high PE stocks suffering more of the contraction.Bear case: quantitative tightening (or lack of) fails to control inflation and a recession follows – either by the disease (stagflation) itself or the subsequent cure.While NFLX had terrible guidance, 20% drop is simply too much punishment for any other time – this excess drop was a good way to calibrate the standards to which companies will be held for the coming few weeks of earnings.',\n",
       " 'P/E is at 305. Analysts have super high expectations, which means if they aren’t met the stock price will tank. In this market, it’s likely tesla will crash. Look at what happened in February 2021 to Tesla when it was consistently reaching ATH. It tanked… hard.Possibly buying 750p but I’ll need to confirm it’s a good purchase this week.

       " \"Missed the $NFLX ER? You and everyone else is currently looking at the next $NFLX like earnings play. One thing is for sure, tech earnings will be volatile and results at the tail end will be more likely than usual. Tail ends are usually hard to predict and the statistic models that calculate premiums usually underestimate them. So it might be the best time to steal from thetagang.That said, I think we'll see two types of tech ER scenarios going forward. Type 1 will be a $NFLX repeat, taking everyone by surprise. More likely will be type 2, everyone is getting scared and the stock tanks before ER and goes up after or stays flat. Let's look at next week, afaik all of these are after hours:Tuesday -  $MSFTDown 13.5% from ATH (historically a lot for Microsoft). P/E is 33.11, EPS is in a healthy uptrend (P/E - price / earnings, EPS - earnings per share).I think this will be type 2: will tank like the rest of the market before Tues, but the actual ER will be fine. Might even be a good idea to go long on this.Wednesday - $TSLA $INTC $NOWThat's where it gets real interesting. Tesla. P/E at an astronomical 306, that is, it is priced for high growth. Everyone already expects a super bullish $TSLA ER, the slightest hint at growth problems and it might tank spectacularily. Elon is currently also down on gambling with company funds on 🌽, but its probably not gonna be significant enough of a loss. I preface this that anyone betting against Elon is already bankrupt, but I think this could be a type 1, given that there is a chance for guidance and growth expectations to be lowered. They will probably still beat earnings for the quarter though, as they beat their delivery goals. Downside is that puts will be expensive and only pay out on a large enough move.Then there also Intel reporting on Wednesday, $INTC is a boomer shit stock that likes to drop on earnings as well. P/E is currently at 10 though. The current market seems to punish high P/E companies more than low P/E companies. While we wouldn't expect much growth with a P/E this low, at 10 we could also say that Intel is a value stock currently and there's better tech stocks to go short on.ServiceNow ($NOW) also is one of these P/E high flyers. Trailing P/E of 90.99 (so averaged over 12 months). Based on the last ER some sites report as high as a 466.29 P/E, but obviously that may be wildly off if their earnings are a bit more seasonal. But I've seen forward estimates over 100 as well. They have a product for companies for tracking and managing business procedures. I haven't used it but seems it overall NOW seems to track and correlate a lot with SPY.  Thursday - $AAPL, $HOOD, $V, $TEAM$AAPL - P/E ratio 28 and EPS in healthy uptrend. Q4 is also a really strong quarter for them usually. Not enough conviction to go long on this one yet, on the other hand I also wouldn't short it. But its likely going to be a Type 2. If it drops some more, BTFD might be a good idea.$HOOD seems like the obvious short, given that they are losing money left and right. But they are already down 80% from their highs so I think there might be not enough meat on the bone left. Maybe it even squeezes, if they can guide higher due to higher Q1 volatility. If thats what makes them earn more money. It's still an absolute POS stock. If it goes up after ER, that would be a good time to short it.$V - P/E 36.60Visa is down 11% from a July 2021 ATH. Financial companies have been under pressure for some time. For me a boomer company, not likely to have an outsized earnings reaction, but who knows maybe this was the non obvious one to go down.$TEAM - Trailing P/E 187.9. Down 38% from ATH.This might fit the bill for a bloated company that got boosted by WFH and covid. Maybe there's still some downside left if the report is bad. Atlassian is mostly known for the dev/wiki like platform everyone hates, Confluence.Disclaimer: I have no positions in any of the mentioned companies at this time. Should $AAPL and/or $MSFT go down more before ER, I might think about going long shares/calls. For a lotto ticket I'd go with $TSLA OTM puts, still not sure if I really want to bet against Elon and will do more DD. $TEAM and $NOW could also be candidates for going short.Edit: added $TEAM and $NOW to the list.Took no positions.How the predictions turned out so far:MSFT up | was up nicely next dayTSLA down |  ~~flat AH~~ down next dayNOW down | +10% next dayINTC maybe slightly down | ~~slightly down AH~~ down next dayAAPL up | up AHHOOD no idea, maybe squeeze | ~~down~~ squeeze next dayV no idea | nicely up next dayTEAM down | up AH, up next day\",\n",

Barring a quick and full recovery to 2019 levels, EV growth is set to throw traditional OEMs\\' cost base off-balance as EVs mostly replace lost ICE sales. With a business model possibly set to generate cash faster than the ability to add product and capacity, analysts wonder how else Tesla could use its balance sheet.Tesla will be ramping two new assembly plants (one in Texas, one in Germany), while attempting to industrialize in-house battery cells. If successful, this latter project could unlock a fearsome increase in production capacity (peers are likely watching these efforts with a mix of dread and wonder). Plus Tesla will be deploying \"single piece casting\" for the first time; this is a novel approach to vehicle assembly that could further increase manufacturing speed.

Loving life...I really believe in this company and think the shares are going to be at $2k-$3k in the next couple of years, so I don't want to sell, but I am paranoid that something is going to happen that causes Tesla stock to lose half its value. I will then freak out, because I lost half of my retirement...I've got a BSc. in economics and worked in director and VP level positions in Silicon Valley for 30 years, so I'm not a moron, but I'm in this weird FOMO situation where I have made a ton of money on TESLA and don't want to lose out on making a ton more.

Yes, they could also be worth $500 by the end of this year, but given their recent Q4 2021 delivery numbers, Giga Austin and Giga Berlin coming online in the next few weeks and the fact that most of the other car companies are wallowing in their own feces, I'm thinking Tesla's prospects are pretty bright.To summarize my entire picture, I have about $1.25 million CAD in my portfolio. Tesla shares make up over $600,000 of this. About $400,000 is in a passive income portfolio that generates about $3,000 a month for me and the rest is in cash, gold, silver, Bitcoin, ether...I would love some suggestions, but I will be very hard pressed to sell any of my Tesla shares.I look forward to all of your responses.\",\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone. Welcome back from a long weekend. If you did not pivot you are unfortunately waking up to reds, and it will probably get worse. We are in a rate rise environment. There are shortages on most resources. Inflation is clearly rampant and at its peak in 40 years. The 10 year T yield has increased its most in 2 weeks that I can remember, indicating bond traders are factoring in multiple rate hikes. Earnings season kicks off big time this week for the end of 4th quarter. So far this morning it is just 7am, the reports have been mediocre, not bad but certainly not good. This is horrible news for an overly inflated market. I hat chats with many over the weekend, and it is really bad that most retail came in after covid…. I am sorry that FURU’s others on social media promised that stocks only go up! I am sorry you were promised unheard or riches and even tried to call out fools on Twitter saying you can turn 1,000 to 100,000. I blasted some AMC/GME furus this weekend and told them straight up that they have caused massive losses by trying to brainwash and tell people things that were not true… My big issue as I have said is trying to convince things based on lies/fud… if you say this is a trade, and you are making a trade, this is based on speculating that is fine… if you are telling people a stock is going to 500, 1,000 and get a bunch of retail to believe you based on lies/fud or speculation you indeed are part of the problem. Many of these furus no 0, nothing of the market, many tv anchors as well, so I cringe when I see things that absolutely don’t even come close to what the company is doing. Remember, a stock and a company are completely different things. It is rare that the stock price mirrors exactly what a company is doing. If we all believed the same thing on a stock it would not move at all, it is an auction! We need people that are clueless. Most of the time in ever trade there is a winner, a loser. Which will you be?! Many are sending me messages saying I am a debbie downer, even saying I am crashing the market… How? I have 350 followers on Twitter, 370 on Youtube, 2,700 on Reddit and like 20 on Stocktwits. For those that think so, you are lucky I am not on TV or have more followers. I am a realist, and I have traded forever! Longer than many have lived. This matters because I have seen fraud, pump and dumps, pyramid schemes. Last year as things pumped, I even said it was a pyramid scheme, called out the bum mods at WSB. That is a place to socialize as they have 11.5 million but in terms of making money that is an enormous losers lounge. I do not care if they see and read this. Yes, indeed it sux when someone tries to stop of a few from making money…. But it is better to stop a few then have millions losing money… no? The point of this paragraph? You can either keep buying the dip, listening to others or you can see the TV, read the news, and see what is happening in front of you….I am getting messages asking me when is PTON, DKNG, PTON, AMC, GME cheap… have you not seen any of my videos? Read any posts?? Because someone on WSB said it is time to buy DKNG at 40 PTON at 80 etc it is time?? Do these companies make money? Do they have sales? Can they prevent the stock from dropping…. I was having a very nice debate with someone yesterday on RKLB. This is a 4.5 billion dollar company with 900 million cash \\\\[Raised from IPO/Offerings\\\\] with increased losses and negative cash flows of nearly 150 million a year…Does that sound good to you? That is not FUD it is off their 10Q SEC documents. It is near 10 a share. If that is not good, should the company be worth 2.2 billion or 5 a share? What if at 5 there is no savior? What is to stop it from going to 1??? At 1 it is still a billion dollar company losing money with no cash flows and no way to prevent the fall…. Get it??? Now, the reddit user was being nice and I am not trying to attack him, but what is the bottom he asked me…. I ask you! Why would someone buy this company in this environment?? Maybe in a bull market when everything is being bidded up regardless of sales/losses, definitely not when fear strikes…. Speculation bubbles..I did a video about 2 weeks ago with my plans going into the year… Someone else asked if I am trying to promote my youtube… Are you kidding me? I am hated because I am real. I don’t even have the 1,500 to get any compensation. For now, I am not focused on views or followers. Those videos are for you and my elite team… There is a possibility in the far future…. I will probably get better compensation if that app still launches to make public my trades…but now things are coming way off I am not sure if it will launch. This video goes over how am I stacking greens, if you are losing, you should spend 10 mins or so viewing it……Puts on high fliers are a go! MELI FRPT and I may be in the green on BA puts today. Earnings are shakey. The mighty GS has missed! I have had GS since 2008! They will be fine but this gives you an idea of what it is going on. If they can miss what will happen to what you own? So I am trading companies that make cash, pay you to HODL. I will buy calls if I want to speculate a little and because rates going higher and companies missing Puts on high fliers! This is from 11 months ago when ARKK Cathie was near an all time high, I have always knocked her the entire year[ have done other posts as well so you see it isn’t like I am trying to say I am a prophet after she started to fall.

The stock has found resistance at the $1200 level and support near $900. The stock finished last week near the center of that range. The company reports earnings Wednesday Jan 26th. Here’s a look at an Iron Condor in the Feb 18th (monthly) expiry. The short strikes of the fly set at the recent support and resistance. You’ll note that is roughly in line with the expected move options are pricing. The risk/reward of the $5 winged Condor is about 2.70 to 2.30. In other words, options are pricing a move to recent support or resistance for earnings, and a breakout or breakdown would mean options were underpriced into the event.

       " '\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0Never mind The Great Reset, the real defining theme of the 2020s and beyond is really The Great Convergence, as in 21st century Globalized Capitalist order is converging into the economic reality of old school Socialist countries.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 Ask people who remember what life was like behind the Iron Curtain, and the consensus answer is\\xa0“we were stressed out about a lot of things, but money was not one of them”. And there was a very good reason for that. In socialist countries the trouble was always that people had money but there was hardly anything to buy. Long lines and waitlists were required for essential/desirable products from food to TVs to automobiles.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0As it turned out, current day capitalist society has become exactly like that, thanks to pervasive labor and material shortages precipitated by Covid induced seismic shift in the labor market.\\xa0The situation is only going to worsen in the coming years as baby boomers, the largest demographic cohort in American history by far, continue to exit the labor market en mass, a process accelerated by a wave of early retirements and buy-outs during the initial lockdown, which saw 30 million boomers retire at once. Welcome to the age of \\xa0permanent scarcity, where goods and services are perpetually backlogged. Americans are now reluctantly getting used to the new normal of empty shelves everywhere as supermarkets regularly run out of essential products from cereals to meat and eggs to toilet papers; restaurants having to massively shrink their menu offerings and routinely run out of entrees; and sought after electronics are not only always sold out but also severely backlogged. And God forbid if you need to hire a contractor to do any construction work. All the good contractors/electricians/plumbers are swamped with work and massively backlogged—if they even bother to take on your project at all.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0 This is the age of scarcity, of labor, of parts and of physical goods and services. \\xa0This is very bad news for the part of the economy that doesn’t have the scarcity factor, namely internet and SaaS stocks, which are already seeing heavy selloff since last year as treasury yield climbed up from the rock bottom. Cloud based products and services are too easy to scale compare to physical ones, and SaaS offerings have little leverage unless combined with a physical component (eg FSD with Tesla vehicle).\\xa0This process will continue in the coming years and will rival the kind of losses that internet stocks endured in the dot com bust. \\xa0This is bad news for Cathie and Ark, as she continues to double down on Docusign, Zillow and other SaaS/Internet plays. The only saving grace in Ark portfolio, and the one company that will save it from blowing up, is TSLA which will go up 10X over the next few years, making up for the losses of her other positions which will go down by 70% or more.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0That is right! TSLA is poised to take off because more than any other company, Tesla is in the enviable position of benefiting from peak scarcity, in both transportation and energy. This translates into insatiable demand that can never be filled, and unlimited pricing power for all the Tesla products and services for the foreseeable future, even as Tesla productions in auto and energy take off big time in 2022 (aka 2020 2, electric boogaloo) thanks to 4680 mass productions. TSLA is the de facto innovation index and the ultimate scarcity economy play. At a time when there is too much money chasing too few quality products in the consumer market, and too much institutional capital chasing too few quality stocks in the financial market, Tesla is where all this consumer and investor money floods into, and the price has nowhere to go except into the stratosphere. The bottom line:US labor force is aging rapidly and gen z are by far the smallest cohort. The same dynamic exists in many other countries including Western Europe and China.This comes at a time when net migration from Mexico to the US is now negative. Not to mention these days young people have many many more options to make money and physical labor is considered undesirable by many. If you look hard enough for a competent contractor and construction crew eventually you will find one, but it will take you much longer and cost you a heck lot more than before. And that goes to my thesis, there are a whole lot more people who have money to spend and invest than people who need jobs. Companies like Tesla that actually can scale and churn out highly sought after products, in auto and energy, stand to reap lions share of profit from this permanent state of scarcity. I suspect Tesla valuation will soar to $10T in the next few years, as the impact of the Scarcity economy sets in, and then continues to grow at 30%+ annual rate afterward for many many years to come. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0',\n",
       " 'Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they’re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. Introduction I know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let’s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).Before we go comparing apples to oranges I’d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.Apple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won’t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won’t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [ Competition is ComingIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [ We can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they’d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven’t perfected a single one yet. In 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that “They’re still catching up with the first iPhone we’ve moved beyond that”. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [ Another year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn’t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. [ A Cult of PersonalityIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. Tesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk’s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.A Tale of Two Boomers Many people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I’d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I’m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.Meet Bob, he’s your average late 50’s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. Bob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he’d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn’t fully understand and hasn’t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.Meet Mike, he’s your average late 50’s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980’s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that’s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak… He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.Several years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. About 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.BTCI’ve always been into computers and began mining this thing called Bitcoin while in college during 2014 which cost about $300 at the time. Over the next three years I accumulated a decent quantity of them. In 2017 the price began to rise significantly and I sold most of them for around $1500-$2500/btc for what I thought was a huge gain. The price continued to climb and I sold the remainder around $5000/btc as I never expected it was possible to achieve that price without being a massive bubble. I was very excited about my returns but I continued to watch the price continue climbing over the coming years and was too nervous to ever fully jump back in. Hindsight is a bitch sometimes but that’s how you learn that things can continue to surprise you far beyond your wildest expectations especially when there is no existing framework for the disruptive technology in question.  This example led me to get a taste of what Bob must feel like, and I am now attempting to hone my foresight so that I can achieve what Mike did. ConclusionMany people have done great work here on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. My general thesis is that TSLA = AAPL but with a much larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)',\n",

       " 'Good morning everyone. This market is definitely tough. This has been the worst 1st week in the market since 2008! Majority of people buy the dip on stocks… experienced traders pivot and change strategy. If you bought the dip on fliers you are down 30-50-70%. I have been thinking about a post/video with safe guard rules that I use, but the debate is because I should not tell people how to trade, everyone should choose their own path. You all read my ideas and thoughts, but I fear with hard cast rules it will possible limit your gains… You see I destroyed my account in the year 2000 and immediately cast about 25 rules I follow so something like that can never happen. Since coming on Reddit I have sprinkled probably all these rules if you have read behind the tea leaves… These rules will 100% absolutely limit your upside! But most importantly it will limit your downside… In 2020 I was up almost 400% and in 2021 about 125%, that may not sound like a lot, but the market came off considerably as the year wore on and I do it safely. I started a small account with 4,000 dollars on December 10th it is now over 6,000 I have used just to trade options and I am down on 1 trade out of maybe 20? I will take pics over the weekend…. Do not be down or mad at yourselves…study strategies, share ideas, if you are down 30% but can get an idea or 2, it can make a huge difference and quickly. Some very important ideas I have is I do not buy dips if a company is not executing! I do not buy more than 2 blocks and usually 10% difference in price…. I may buy more blocks but in much smaller increments as Dan and Sparky have done well with this strategy. For volatile stocks or when I am unsure, this may be the way.This is why I discourage people from down voted 1 another because you just never know what idea can be shared and make a huge difference in your account. I am learning tips, tickers and ideas from all of you as well…. I may come across as arrogant but we are online/behind a computer, I am very easy going and far from it… However I am extremely confident, secure, and I will tear down someone who acts as though they know it all. I do believe I belong with the money managers but this is my birth right… Maybe Carl Icahn, Ray Dalio grew up in the market, and it was infused when they were kids but the rest do it for the money! There is no problem doing it for the money, but someone born to do this, that has it running thru their veins is very different from someone born for this. There are plenty of great basketball players, but Lebron James is 1 in a decade/decades… Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, they had a natural talent and were born for this, they had help and guidance in order to see their skill/talent blossom…. When I was 16 I took the train on Friday’s and just showed up at my brokers office in Manhattan, out of no where. He did not ask me… but I figure I call the guy to get quotes and pay JB Oxford 50 a trade I should be allowed.. he did not expect it and did not know I was a kid… Every Friday I’d finish my classes around 1-2PM and race to his office, I did not have a car! I had to take a bus, then a train! 45-75 mins commute, and I was a kid with a school bag…. Are you willing to do this? Or you just want to copy trades? I write all of these briefings so that people can get ideas, strategy and can also make plays, share ideas, infuse it with their own strategy…It is important to watch winning trades, study them…. But it is more important to know why, so that it can be done again and again and again and again! Many of the generals have evolved with me and traded with me since February. We are still evolving, and even if we do not agree on everything we share ideas to help one another…… So please just read ideas and help 1 another, if your idea is working and someone asks you how, what you did, you can share it! I have been writing daily briefings since February!!! No one is paying me, so share some ideas and please don’t knock someone if they are winning…..This arises from a few messages yesterday about people that just want the trade, and try and mirror it. This is not the strategy for long term trading! See the idea and why, you will be set for life! If you do not understand why, study, ask questions, but we all have different fave tickers, strategies.I will take some pics around 9:30-10AM of the 10Q on RBLX which is official data from the SEC not fud. I know that 99% of traders in this stock are not aware of financials and earnings on the company and I am bearing making trades via PUTS. I am sorry if it makes some lose money..but think of it this way I have been warning people since it took off to 140 on momentum/speculation and shouldn’t I have a right to take advantage of retail as the stock is probably worth 60-70 at the moment! It can go higher eventually… but the keyword is eventually. This is no where near a 55 billion dollar company. They have sales on the year nearly 1 billion and lose 300-400 million on those sales…. Take a step back and tell me why that’s not bad, but horrible…I understand growth is near 100% but it will have to grow at 100% for 2-3 years straight then we can talk!I am not sure when the last time I traded GME was but I estimate around 2010-2011. Around 2005-2008 they had a monopoly I traded it a ton! In 2021 I traded AMC just a few times, I did not throw a lot of grenades until July, I was working full time and didn’t want to miss an exit being busy with a customer. If you can not be on your computer or phone watching quotes it is dangerous to trade volatile stocks. I will not trade the shares of GME because the capital needed but I will buy bearish bets and a small risk, of $2,000. This is only if the stock rises to 160-180. GME and AMC still have a cult following and army. The stock market is a popularity contest!! RADA announced officially they had record sales and grew year over year 54% and is profitable, and what did the stock do? I will buy calls because they are giving you a forecast of the 4th quarter, we already know now earnings will be good!I took a look at BBBY earnings, it was bad, not horrible, but bad… I took a look at the guidance it was ok, slightly bad, retail saved me… I will buy puts on days this flies. BBBY was a solid business just a few years ago and there is a reason why it is short 35%...... I will still keep trading my super defensive dividend stocks, and buying calls on super value. BBD, IVR, AFIN, NYMT, BRMK…. ZEUS with great earnings and making cash…. TUP was going back up… it is a rotation, lets see!Hot money be careful!ABSI – Grenade, deal with MRK insane volume, retail is choosing…DWAC – Grenade with potential, may be on watch after it was announced social media site will be running 3rd week of FebruaryGBX – Unshortable, railroad tracks and parts builder, defensive play, beat earnings, let me see, I have been trading this for yearsGME – Grenade, NFT, Crypto news, unless this flies I will stay on the sidelinesGOGL – Unshortabe, I was trading this from 8-9 after the dividend and it has taken off!

Instead of picking up the dead mans gun and running at the machine gunner, maybe look around at the pile of men around you.  “The Short Shorts HistorianHere to educate you about the inaccurate predictions of Tesla short sellers (also known as $TSLAQ).”Edit:For those arguing about valuation, their forward P/E is around 100 (Q4 estimates are really far off.  Wait until earnings and watch it trade up as a result, just like deliveries).  Tesla only needs to double deliveries once to likely fill in its valuation.Tesla will more than double revenue with doubled deliveries as prices have gone up, model s sales were basically nothing before the release of the refresh near end of 2021, and demand is leading to premium model sales first, with doubled revenue it could likely triple earnings, which would give it a forward P/E of near 30.   It is possible tesla will deliver 2M autos this year, more than doubling revenue, potentially tripling profits, and filling in its current price.  A 30 P/E would be low for a company that has 2x-3x’d earnings in the part year, and has a decade long history of 50% CARG.  So a forward P/E of 30 is approximately 12-18 months out.Also attached is the Foward P/E for other companies.  Notice the FAANGs are around 30 forward P/E but with much less growth than tsla (wasnt amazon negative growth recently?  I dotn track those some Im not commenting on their position, more just that it obviously a far forward P/E for tsla that has higher growth than most of the FAANGs).',\n",

       " 'Good morning everyone. The market was actually not bad at all if you were trading in real companies! Companies with a PE, make cash/have cash, great financials, pay a dividend. I have preached this for months. Please go back to “Daily Plays” starting October 1st. All you need to do is click on “Daily Plays” it will sort only these posts. I got back into options on October 1st and immediately I began bear bets on stuff like BILL, SNOW, SE, DASH, HUBS, CRWD, TWLO, MDB, RBLX and now TSLA. There were a few other high fliers but it is important to see the psyche, understand why, the process and what I saw so that you too can see the thought process. While things were higher and flying throughout the year, trust me, I was called dumb, outdated, an old trader, a suit a boomer…. My trading experience gives me foresight. I do not care what they say on TV, I do not care what analysts, CEO’s say. I do not even care what someone on social media says, another redditor. I am not here for acceptance, confirmation from other traders, as I have said, I have done this so long, I am extremely confident in my ability, so much so that I could have conversations will Ray Dalio,Warren Buffet, Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman, David Tepper, Ken Griffin, Stephen Cohen, Chase Coleman and not only would it be a conversation, after 5-10 mins I am certain they would think that I am some big money manager, hedge fund manager or even offer me a position. Gabe Plotkin who is now famous for GME short was under the wing of Stephen Cohen and was great friends with Ken Griffin… To me, in all honesty the only thing that separates myself and them is they have billions that to me, are mines! I chose to go into the abyss in 2000 with the dot com crash and because my hiatus others rose. I am not here for an ego boost, the importance of this is, I strongly know, not believe that “I” could be the figure on CNBC that people interview and look to for ideas… It is probably better that I do not, because I would give it to people raw, respectful but tell people like it is……I recall in February, and I may search for threads with Cathie Wood, although there are to many that me saying she will fall flat people called for my ban. When I said AMC/GME was dangerous for the health of the market people called me a boomer. My hopes is that people on Twitter start to follow my plays…..I am happy I have come on Reddit first, as we all know GME/AMC hysteria started on WSB. Though for the past 3 months since CEI/DATS I have not really tried to recruit members on this sub because I have seen the power of Twitter. I started using Twitter a lot because of Zack and crew the way they moved CEI/DATS. I do not expect to have 500k-1 million followers there because I keep it real, so I do not care if the furus get credit for calling my plays. However I am gaining traction, tagging FURU’s, TV heads, analysts and as long as people recognize I know the deal in time I really hope to have a “Play of the Day” every day and it truly will have no one holding the bag! On New years Day, one of the generals sent me a screen shot of Zack tweets, as he has blocked me on Twitter, it had a resolution saying something like this year no one will get caught holding the bag.. We are 2 days into trading and he is pumping garbage still and people are caught WTF. Like I said, I do not care if he sees this, he is linked, Atlas Crew, I am following over 50 so called furus with 50K+ followers each and most if not all are scalpers/momentum traders… which I have said all along work for very few and work well only in a bull run straight up. You will see me calling them out if you follow my twitter. I am straight telling them I am buying puts on SNOW, TSLA, RBLX good luck on your long calls! Straight up! These people think because they made money in 2020/2021 that certifies them as money making gurus! Make me laugh! There is 1 guy that I do believe is good, DaytraderBrian Jones, but this guy spends 50% of his time smashing furus and the system… Why waste our time? Its ok you throw shade at them but half his tweets are just smashing them, and at least tag them… I tag them and I have been blocked by a few, Tim Sykes I am surprised because I didn’t really say anything bad about him, yet….but whatever. These people do not have anything special to me, I do not follow anyone not 1, because I think they have great ability, I follow them to see what they are pumping! Would I like to follow someone that trades great companies? Has great ideas? 100%. That is why we have UltimateTraders, we share ideas and can come up with plays/ideas… the thing is I do not believe we have the same effect on a ticker as twitter…. If this was WSB with 11 million absolutely! But it is not… WSB is a huge losers lounge, trust me I tell the mods that in messages and would laugh at them and tell them straight to their face, and trust me I do not care if they see this and a few WSB mods follow me….however they have 11 + million apes! That is indeed powerful, just like these furus with millions of followers…. Yesterday morning I started tagging many important people about TSLA, stating facts, providing pictures, proof it skied to 1,210 and crashed! I am a nobody I do not think that was all me, but it definitely helped! Definitely! Why? I was replying to furus with 100-500K followers, directly responding to them calling TSLA longs, I was saying thank you for my fresh puts with facts!!! I was tweeting and tagging TV anchors/analysts with facts proof, even firms! I have done the same on BILL, SNOW, SE, RBLX….I remember I called out an analyst on twitter while she was live on CNBC calling RBLX the best thing since sliced bread when it was 130. I told her why she is a joke… Morgan gave it an upgrade I said the same… Why does this all matter?.........Rotation…..I am starting to see cash kings move. AXL, TWI, NEXA, GOGL, SWBI they are coming to life. ZIM, ZEUS… I am sorry I did speculate a little but this market is not the environment for it! In 3 weeks when earnings comes out if companies slam earnings we will speculate on stuff like AFRM, PUBM, PATH, PINS, ZM but until then I do not want to buy companies with a PE over 30! You think NET, OKTA, CRWD is low? WTF is that? SQ? PYPL? WTF is that? They do not make serious cash they are what I call “Hot Potatoes” they make some cash but are sky high. If you are in a stock with a PE ratio over 60 be careful! Why cant it go lower? Remember this is an auction, your stock will keep falling until the company buys or a white knight comes in to save….. Last week someone was going long on RBLX while I was buying PUTS. That is fine, I wish you the best of luck, I want no one to lose money but think of this.. And these are facts..Microsoft paid 2.5 billion for Minecraft, in 2014. Minecraft had more in sales than RBLX! RBLX is valued at 60 billion. You tell me who can buy out RBLX and at a premium. I do not think the shareholders want $100 like Nancy Pelosi who bought $100 strike which was in the money and expires in 1/2023? Was that even bullish. And I do not care, Nancy is not Ultimate, Nancy now has a bunch of apes that think she is the new Cathie Wood…RBLX was near $150 around 100 billion market cap. WTF company can pay a premium for RBLX??? Redditor FB is worth 900 billion and makes a profit. WTF would they pay 100+ billion for a company with barely 1 billion in sales and loses 250 million a year… Get real, Zuck has made some mistakes especially with this Meta fiasco, as I said before, that was truly a big mistake and for 50K I would have flew anywhere in the world and consulted him for a few days before this mishap. Yes it is a mishap! Can Meta work 1 day? Yes, but definitely not now..I do believe Crypto, NFT hype and euphoria influenced him…. I am not surprised he delayed the ticker change, and if he is smart he will try to unwind this Meta joke… This can be possible like the Movie Ready Player one, where people wear glasses all day and spend cash on a fake virtual world, but that is the very small minority. If even 1% that would absolutely shock me. If he wanted to make a push for AR/VR like Apple saying they are making glasses, ok, that I agree with, it may be possible, but to transition the entire company now into Meta what a joke. Those analysts just are scared to tell him like it is…If it was to divert the negative energy from FB, ok but there were way cheaper ways and smarter ways.. before this FB was in the news every other week for IG and bullying and selling data…. Still as I said way better ways…..So I will still trade cautiously and puts on high fliers. I may buy calls if something dips hard.

I believe there was some tax loss selling and some people finally were able to buy some of these names back. Used car prices have soared higher and both companies will benefit big time. LAD, KMX which are cash cows are growing sales at 20-30%, it makes sense for them since they can not grow organically, but sell used cars to buy growth for under 500 million. SFT and LOTZ are growing extremely fast and both LAD, KMX have the power/cash to do so, many times just buy competition.

There is no question eventually the cash cows will figure it out. I have been trading BBD for months now, in different blocks. NM shot from 3.50 to 4.30! They ship and make cash, but do have a lot of debt. They aren’t super defensive but with supply chain restraints around the world companies like NMM, NM, ZIM, GOGL will be cashing in.I bought PUTS on MDB about 2 weeks ago, the stock price was about $550. I got February strikes of 470. The stock went as high as 565 and my puts decreased in value from $16 to 6! Originally, I had wanted $25 on these puts but I set a good to cancel at $20. Around open yesterday the stock opened down near 20 and my order executed. MDB dropped near $50 and the puts were worth over 30! What a ride, I have been trading RBLX puts back and forth and I am down now but not worried. I do not care what Pelosi does, and so you know her calls were in the money and expire in 2023? Is that bullish? People trade out of options most of the time, it is the apes that will hold till the end. I have traded TSLA puts all week last week. I am down now but will begin my offensive on Twitter near 9:30AM. The facts are this. On 40,000 more deliveries 309K total the market cap went up 150 billion. TSLA does not have 50 billion in sales…. Mercedes \\\\[DDAIF 3 million cars a year\\\\] worth 80 billion and BMW \\\\[BMWYY 3 million cars a year\\\\] Worth 70 billion are also making electric cars and I will post the new Benz that goes 620 miles in a single charge and looks amazing. So Mercedes and BMW together sell 6 million cars a year, have cash, make cash and give dividends, can not even amount to what TSLA gained in a day for selling 40k more vehicles. FACTS!!! I am not saying they are worth more, the growth is very good on TSLA. I am saying based on the current fundamentals and delivery all year TSLA should not be over 300, which is still valued over Toyota which sells 10 million cars. If you want to believe TSLA will overtake Toyota in car sales within the next few years, good luck. The truth of the matter is TSLA is worth more than Ford, Toyota, GM, Lucid, Rivian, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Honda, Nio, Nissan, Li, Xpev, Stellantis \\\\[Chrysler/Fiat\\\\] all combined…..That is 35 million cars sold worldwide versus 936k?? Get real, if you want to tell me that every single car manufacturer is going out of business you are absolutely delusional. I would say you are crazy if you think that TSLA will overtake Toyota, but who knows in 10 years, I do however know that 15 car companies aren’t going out of business and TSLA will be alone. In fact you can add the top 5 Solar companies, the top 5 AI companies and TSLA is worth more than all 25 combined for those that say this is a tech company, which by the way is trading on stock action which has 0 to do with company execution. The rise up in TSLA was not company execution, it was meme #1, short/gamma squeeze. Yesterday was gamma squeeze, if you think the deliver of 40K more vehicles for a company that doesn’t even have 50 billion in sales should be worth 1.2 trillion, I am sorry you havent been in the market to see giants fall. In 1999 Cisco CSCO was by far the largest traded company in the US. It was roughly 550 billion. They were the backbone of the internet, baby CSCO…JNPR was the best thing since sliced bread… John Chambers the CSCO CEO then, was God! CSCO would be like a 2-3 billion dollar company with that valuation. Now it is 266!!!!..What happened? Competitors! Hype machine, speculation… and CSCO financials were stronger? You think this is fud research CSCO! JNPR! It is very important to have market history because you would have seen these things before and you laugh! The difference is now people are all connected and things/information flow so fast so you get extremes to the up and to the downside. Do I think TSLA can 1 day be worth 1,200? Yes, it is possible but we are years away. Why? As I wrote before, they do not make money! They do not have the sales capable to be worth more than 30 companies. For those they keep trying to tout ROBO taxi. Let me tell you a history lesson of engineers, and the stock market. BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL FRIES.The company that has the most cash along with the highest stock price will have the best engineers and technology. You must have both….WHY? because if you have no cash you must pay your talent in shares, if your shares drop your talent leaves.. When does that happen? When supply overflows the market. Take a look at form 4 for TSLA. Everyone inside is selling, daily! They don’t even care about the job they are millionaires on stock sales. They may leave, or retire like their Truck president who cashed out 4 billion earlier on this year or may start up competition… I say this because who on this planet has more money than AAPL? NO ONE!!!! AAPL has 600 billion in cash and generates insane cash.. Why does this matter? TSLA has 16 billion in cash and 18 billion in short term debt, never mind long term. They are insolvent and if they don’t slam new shares will be printed 2022 you heard it here. Why does that matter? Insiders selling, new print, massive dilution coming, when stock dives new talent wants cash or someone else who pays more.. Yeah your welcome for the lesson. In life most people want more money so if you think that TSLA will retain talent when they make no cash you are going to get slammed in time… Why? because every employee is working to dump shares into supply! WAKE UP that is how the stock market works……..AMC CEO yesterday is forecasting what is about to happen. He wants convertible bonds which will crush apes. The apes cant read the tea leaves. He said his resolution is to work off the debt or get better terms.. Let me tell you that doesn’t happen unless there is convertible bonds. What does that mean? That the lender is able to convert the loan into shares that they dump into retail.. When it depends on the terms… However I can tell you no one would be that dumb as the lender to AMC to lower a rate from 17% without having the ability to make more money by instantly dumping into retail. I have videos on the health of a company is not from the stock price. IT IS SEEN THRU THEIR BONDS!! If you do not want to spend 2 hours checking a 10Q check the rate of their loans/bonds. If it is 8+% unfortunately you are trading garbage. AAPL has a rate of 2% and can pay off all their debt at ease. Unlike TSLA they bought near 90 billion worth of stock in 2021. TSLA is insolvent and may need to print new shares if they do not knock it out of the park. TSLA bonds by the way are near 5.5% and were near 8% in 2020 when the company was near bankruptcy.

       " \"I've been doing about a year and a half of investing/swing trading, and some things still surprise me. I learned that you buy the rumor and sell the news. usually stocks dip after major positive announcements that fit the expectations. So I expected to TSLA to dip at least slightly after people take profits on a pretty obvious Q4 sales numbers report. People knew that Tesla would exceed earnings, and delivery predictions for Q4. So why did the stock go up 14% after the announcement? I understand that TSLA isn't a typical stock in terms of stock price movements because of the fanbois and media coverage. But I'd still want to apply this to general investing principles and strategies that I should watch out for, or that I missed this time around.Edit: thanks for answering my questions.

Elon Musk is doing literally everything he can to suck up to China, give the US government shit over paying taxes, treat his workers like shit, build cars with crappy build standards, I can go on but my hands will burst into flames. One thing that I have grown weary of is Saagar's monologues on Fauci. Look I hear you, and I agree with alot of what you are reporting on, and some of your opinions, but it's getting long in the tooth. And to be fair, if Saagar were to be equally critical of Musk as he would be of Fauci, I think one would not call Tesla the amazing car company that it is. Also, I'd hate to defend Fauci, but he is an accomplished scientist and is dealing with an incredibly difficult pandemic, partially, and possibly of his own creation; that's a task far more difficult than running an electric vehicle manufacturer. Or tech company. Or power company. Or robotaxi company. Or power credit company. Or whatever ridiculous narrative or story the street or the company is giving it these days. I honestly hate the media figure that Fauci has grown into and wish that he'd stop doing the rounds on TV. In fact, TSLA is one big financial fairy tale that Wall Street has given a moonshot multiple, has relied on tax subsudies to become profitable, loses money on each car made, yet somehow is the future? Games like TSLA not getting the scrutiny they deserve are a contributing factor to why we have a runaway financial system and a global elite that can basically play nations off each other, and basically operate above and around our legal and regulatory systems.

       " 'Analysts had been anticipating a larger impact from the global semiconductor/shipping constraints on 4Q deliveries (as Tesla highlighted several supply chain challenges on its 3Q21 EPS call that had been impacting its ability to keep factories running at full speed). The strong results imply that the company benefited from a combination of strong operational execution and improving output at the Shanghai factory (e.g., Tesla delivered over 50k China-made vehicles in both October/November, per the CPCA).Importantly, Tesla is nearing start of production for the Model Y at both its Austin and Berlin plants. The company had previously been targeting end of 2021 for first production builds at the two new factories, and some media reports suggest Tesla could complete the first production Model Y builds in Texas very soon.[',\n",
       " \"Tesla's (TSLA) resiliency is on display again this morning after the company reported electrifying Q4 delivery results that not only smashed analysts' expectations but also set a new company record. Undeterred by ongoing supply chain obstacles, total deliveries surged by 71% yr/yr to 308,000 vehicles, with Model 3 and Model Y leading the way. On a combined basis, TSLA delivered nearly 297,000 of those two vehicles, up 83% from a year earlier.From a broader perspective, it's clear that consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs) continued to strengthen as 2021 came to a close, providing TSLA and its counterparts with a powerful tailwind. This upswing was also illustrated by impressive December delivery reports from China-based EV makers NIO (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV), which registered yr/yr growth of 50% and 181%, respectively. Along with sizable governmental tax credits, major advances in battery technology and more affordable price points have elevated EVs to the mainstream.For TSLA, the Q4 delivery report puts a bullish bookend on a year that became a bit bumpy. After CEO Elon Musk followed through on the results from his own Twitter (TWTR) poll by selling 10% of his TSLA holdings, vehicle recall issues emerged again late last week. Earlier in 2021, safety concerns over TSLA's autopilot system prompted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to conduct an investigation into the self-driving technology, leading to a high-profile recall. This time, the issue stems from faulty hoods and backup cameras, causing TSLA to recall about 500,000 vehicles.\",\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone and hopefully we all start off fresh and things get off to a good start. The 4th quarter ended and 4th quarter earnings season will really kick off 3rd week of January, normally with the banks/financials. Before I decide what to do, that is to go offensive or speculate I will wait till these earnings. It is my belief that we are set up, unfortunately for a declining year. We have inflation rampant, production issues, shortages in every industry, limited resources around the world, rates will rise, we are also coming off a 25% increase in a single year on the SP… how do you beat that? It all comes down to earnings. Last year 1st Quarter 2020, and 2nd quarter 2020 were almost historic. The 2nd quarter was actually the 3rd best earnings quarter since SP has been tracked! So it was ok to speculate because companies were generally beating earnings and making that cash! Then came the 3rd quarter.. Although not a bad quarter it was not as close to record breaking, even the mighty FB, AMZN, AAPL disappointed!!! These were also signs for me to back off. At the end of the day there is no news more important than earnings unless you have a buy out offer…. Stocks these days will move faster on other news and more than earnings, but earnings will be the true teller of what happens… AFRM flew near 200 on AMZN news and contract… then earnings slumped its now near 100!! Do not be fooled, nothing is more critical than earnings and 10Q financials….NOTHING….TSLA delivered 309k cars beating 270K estimate… It is flying and the news is indeed good….However, what does that translate to when earnings comes out near the end of the month? I can guarantee and bet anyone it will not be $10 per share even with the sale of EV credits… Why do I say that? TSLA now trades at near 1,150 a share.. To trade at 1,150 and growing sales at near 40%, with great financials \\\\[Which they don’t\\\\] you can give this 100x PE.. They will make near 4-5 dollars on the year! That puts the stock price at 400-500 and that is 100x PE and if they deliver. Toyota sells 10 million cars, Volkswagen sells 9.6, GM 8, Ford 6… TSLA is valued higher than them all combined. Along with the 5 largest Solar companies, along with the 5 largest AI companies, so if you want to believe that 15+ companies are going out of business and TSLA will be a monopoly I am sorry to say I want to sell you multiple bridges.. In other words anyone long is paying an insane premium now for flawless execution for 2-5 years. That wont be me, I do not see any upside near term aside from apes and cult bidding it up…. That said I had told some generals on this news, especially the way they are splashing headlines I wanted to buy calls for 1,150… now It is already up 70+, I am unsure, I may continue to trade puts and hope it heads higher. I am still trading mainly money makers that pay dividends. BBD, GOGL, NYMT, IVR, AFIN etc and at least trade cash cows like ZIM, NMM, ZEUS and maybe some calls..

I chose 1/1/2020 as the starting date because I believe most investors probably had never heard of ARKK before 2020 and therefore would not have been invested.If you had invested $10,000 into SPY/TSLA, you'd have $24,976 today.If you had invested $10,000 into ARKK, you'd have $19,370.(Yes, I realize that SPY does contain a bit of TSLA so in actuality the first portfolio has like 11-12% TSLA. But it doesn't really change the overall result)Edit: I did the same analysis using different starting years. The SPY/TSLA portfolio still wins out if you start with 1/1/2019 or 1/1/2018.

       " '\\tTesla target raised to $262 at Citigroup; remains Sell rated  (1086.19)Citigroup raises their TSLA tgt to $262 from $236. Analyst Itay Michaeli said, \"We are raising our 2021-23 EPS estimates to reflect strong Q4 trends and improving supply/demand dynamics. Despite some known near-term margin headwinds (new capacity ramping, supply-chain/commodities), we believe that EV supply/demand will remain strong enough to continue driving YoY margin expansion, particularly in the U.S., where Tesla\\'s share is strongest. Reflecting this view, we are also raising our price target to $262 from $236 on modestly higher terminal value ASPs/margins in our scenario analysis. Our new target equates to ~23x our new 2023E EPS (excluding credits) and a ~$294bln market cap. Our Sell rating reflects our view of risk/reward at the current valuation, which we believe embeds expectations for (a) Tesla selling ~20mln units by ~2030, an implied market share outcome that is not supported by our prior market analysis, and (b) a clear lead in AV/FSD revenue pools (RoboTaxi, subscriptions/sharing), which our latest AV industry assessment does not support.\"',\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone. Another day to be careful. Don’t be down on yourselves if you are having a tough couple of months or several weeks. This is not easy. Not everyone can win all the time. I saw a segment on CNBC yesterday, that you can probably look up where 90% of money managers this year have did worse than the SP500. It is hard to beat the SP year in and year out because it consistently has come in at 8% since inception in 1957. Many managers can do 15-20% or even like Cathie Wood 150% in 2020. But it is hard to consistently do that. I came on Reddit January and immediately would knock down posts praising Wood and saying it would be a matter of time. I would even search the posts if that was easy. However it wouldn’t because it is December? How did I know this? Because her strategy and what/how she trades.. She buys DIPS when things get bad… people that use that strategy are bound to get crushed eventually…. As the saying goes… let your winners ride/win cut your losers. I believe many of her tickers will work eventually but majority will fail flat. Paul Tudor Jones and many others used the strategy of buying a little of everything good and winning big time… What I respect about this is that he would let it be known that was his strategy. What I do not like about Wood is that she either is senile or paints the idea that all her stocks are going to make it, change the world and now she is saying she will be up 40% per year for 5 years… Can it be done, yes, and it still can, but to flat out say that is amusing…..I do not have a problem if a furu/trader says they trade grenades and have become very good at it. I have a problem when they say CEI 10, DATS 30, CNTX 15, PROG 15, ATER 50, because it paints a false hope. There are plenty of people I follow on Twitter that are momentum traders, they do state they are amazing but at least they don’t do that….. They do say in their profile this isn’t investment advice, do your own DD etc.. However whether or not they make these trades, win big, it paints a false hope that everyone can do it.. So be careful out there. This is not easy.. If a furu came out and said, this is just a trade, or a grenade, followers wouldn’t buy and it wouldn’t pump. If you check my daily plays since July, I am the only one that calls these grenades because they are up on retail/pumps. I think it is very important that you know the risk before a trade so I do so. It is rare to have an unshortable in hot money, and sometimes runners because furus/retail push stocks that are more easy to move… I will know when it is safe once I do not see as many grenades in hot money and see some real companies. To me, to be in hot money you need to be up near 5% and have heavier than normal volume compared to how you usually trade. I was asked many times yesterday, when I think it will end, and why people cant make the same money now as they did months ago. Speculation is getting hit, Crypto, hit, fear is amongst some retail, and that is actually good for the health over all in the market… How can you value a company without sales, losing money more than a real company? If that is the case then how do we know the value of any company. I was chatting with a general last night about FCEL. A 2.5 billion dollar company… On the hype last month with Biden Bill it was 12+ 5 billion… Well it just reported sales of 13.9 million, a decrease from 17 million a year ago. They were supposed to have sales near 22 million. They lost 23 million on these sales of 13.9 million. Last year they lost 17 million on 17 million sales. WTF is this? Who did this? What is retail buying? When will they ever if ever have sales to boast a 2.5 billion market cap? And this was insanely higher on pump before. How many years will it take for them to make a penny? When stuff like this goes on, and I will post 300-500 tickers pumped by retail, take a look at the sales, the earnings…. Are there any? Real companies are getting hit as money flows into the chasers/grenades…FOMO. …..I was just having a chat with a general. Who was saying people are losing on my value plays.. Well why would someone buy a real company RADA, VOXX, NLS, EAF, when they can buy something like RELI, ISIG, AVCT \\\\[offering yesterday\\\\].. Money must flow. Stocks like HUN, TWI, QDEL, HIMX are far higher now then when I traded them on Reddit firstly…but every company must be evaluated each quarter. These value plays are also coming with good reports and will come back, and they will come back faster once speculation folds. Why must that happen? The money has to come from somewhere… Not sure what the momentum traders will do then, and if they shift.. No one wants to play tickers that are 3-5% gains, everyone wants 20-50-100% and its happening now so ISIG is giving people hope. For myself, I need to see a pivot in the market to know its safe. We are not setup for a great 2022. Rates will rise, inflation, Covid, production halts/constraints. To be a great trader you need to see everything around you and be ahead of the game.. History/experience does matter, and it doesn’t matter until everyone loses their shirts… Bury is famous because he was a money manager warning everyone in 2008, and making the bets, I foresaw this way early as well, as I am stating all the signs. I do not care to get credit, this for me is all the obvious…. You can make money and trade the grenades but be careful.. and the best sign for me that it is ready to buy the dip on growth is when speculation is absolutely hammered….Not everyone belongs in the market, and some need to get hurt to stabilize and have a real market….I have taken about 65k in losses for this year, double last year when I had 32 and just 1 loser. I have taken a little under 10 and still hold about 15 losers. Many of which are Chinese plays.. My biggest misstep this year were the mortgage plays which should be much higher and the Chinese plays, hammered do to political backlash. I could not foresee mortgage plays as they are profitable have sales and make money… I mean FCEL is valued more than LDI+HMPT check yourself and they make money and pay dividends and have growth! …. I did see some signs with the Chinese stocks but did not even imagine it would be this bad. BABA was nearly 300 dollars and if someone would have said BABA will be near 100 December 31st 2021 id have laughed and asked because of a split? BABA is at near a 5 year low!ISIG really went from 10 to 30 in a few days.. if this was the summer time I would have traded it, maybe even September but once October rolled around, it is capital preservation time and not just making money, but it continues to be hot..RELI was all over Stocktwits, Reddit and a little Twitter, let us see!ARDS – GrenadeBVXV – Grenade had an offering last weekEFOI – GrenadeISIG – Grenade, hot all weekISPC – GrenadeKPRX – Old GrenadeRELI – Grenade, ChatterThe contents of this post are for information and entertainment purposes only and does not constitute financial, accounting, or legal advice. ...

Nonetheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remained positive due to reopening beneficiaries such as Walt Disney and Boeing.* Trading was choppy as thin volumes exaggerated moves, with shares changing hands in the major benchmarks about a third lower than daily averages for the previous 30 days.* Global equities are on track for a third year of double-digit returns, fueled by the surge in the United States.

       " 'The linchpin to the overall bull thesis on Tesla remains China, which analysts estimate will represent 40% of deliveries for the EV maker in 2022. While PR/safety headwinds were front and center in China earlier this year, the demand trend appears to be reversing aggressively in a bullish way for Tesla into year-end with the company now on a \\\\~50k monthly run-rate for China in 4Q that could ramp further into early 2022. The chip/component shortage remains a headwind for Tesla (and every other automaker) however this as a transitory issue with Model 3/Y demand which is outstripping supply by roughly 15% as it stands heading into year-end. Analysts estimate the China story is worth $400 per share to the Tesla story for 2022.[',\n",
       " 'Good morning everyone. We did have a nice overall rally yesterday but I have been trading to long to believe the coast is clear. Record cases of Covid across the US, the world, we are seeing shut downs. Apple is even closing stores. Interest rates are going to rise soon, inflation is high, surprisingly the dollar is holding steady \\\\[that is because the rest of the world is dumping\\\\] I am waiting for real Gold/Silver to rise. \\\\[SBSW\\\\] Some people like Crypto, ok calls on HIVE HUT ANY GREE BITO…..but I prefer the real asset. I do believe there is a place for Crypto but it isn’t for everyone. I have yet to buy 1 directly and I had opened an account with Kucoin with 2,000 a few weeks ago and then everything crashed…..If the world slows, production slows, their will be more shortages, production delays, earnings will fall…. When rates rise earnings will fall… these are common sense facts if you have been trading a long time. For these reasons I will remain cautious. 4th quarter ends soon, earnings season will kick off about the 3rd week of January, usually with the banks/financials. We will see, if earnings look great I will buy in, until then, I will toss only a few grenades \\\\[way high, I cant justify the price\\\\] or hot potatoes \\\\[real companies with PE ratios like 100+, ROKU TWLO UPST etc\\\\]. I will keep trading my cash cows that have very low PE ratios, make cash and have the power/financials to buyback or do a special dividend. Super defensive stocks pay 8%+ in dividends if you hodl, or banks with low PE and 5% dividends. That is what I feel safe trading. I do buy calls at the moment if I want to speculate a little…I bought TSLA puts yesterday first time in 4 ½ years and I feel confident after seeing their 10Q and checking cash burn. This is now a 1.1 trillion dollar company that doesn’t make money! They make about 3 dollars per share. \\\\[Subtract EV credits\\\\]. I am down for now on MDB RBLX puts but I don’t buy lottos so I have some time. I would never recommending YOLO on any options. Yes, you can win big, but you can lose it all. I have puts on INNV which I was up last Thursday over 100% in 10 mins and didn’t take it… I am still up but 33%... I didn’t sell yet because the company makes money with enrollments into healthcare and has been sanctioned by the insurance police and told they must suspend new enrollments…They are under investigation… Some of you may think TSLA RBLX is going higher, and it could because this is indeed a popularity contest and the price is judged by an auction. However there are no facts, fundamentals that can back any of these current prices. And as I have said before this Meta crap, FB stunt I hope was a way to divert negative publicity because it is and will be a flop. We are to early on for this VR world with goggles. \\\\[Ready Player One Movie\\\\] FB is a trillion dollar company and they can afford this misstep but wow pretty dumb, yes I say dumb and I don’t care who they hired and who they consulted, they did not consult me. Will this work later on? Yes, possibly but then we are speculating again. I do not speculate I have traded since the 90s, I blew up my account in 2000 speculating….. I rather pay more money for the company once it is near execution than 10x now. What will this stock if company fails, as we are payinga premium now? What does that mean? TSLA is growing sales at 30-40% year over year.. Even if you love this stock and must own it a 100x PE gives this at most a 300 price… and I would only give 100x for something very solid financially… TSLA is not solid at all, take a look at the 10Q yourself…if you want to speculate then there should be a reason….AHPI has been in business since the 70s. This was a business that was just getting by. There was not much use for oxygen tanks and portable ventilators, aside from hospitals/urgent cares…AHPI sells to consumers for as cheap as $125 a tank or $350 a mobile ventilator… Yes, this isn’t a booming business but hello! This is a 24 million dollar company not a billion. This is a company just years ago was just breaking even, small losses and did not have sales of over 25 million… Fast forward to Covid…Sales boomed to a record 36 million last year and they were profitable. What do you think it will be now? No, I am not saying this is the best thing since sliced bread… However if this is a 50 million dollar company \\\\[12 a share is that high\\\\]? What if the company makes 2-4 million dollars therefore trading between 12 and 25 PE for something that only had 36 million in sales. Imagine they get some big contract or some celebrity says what the heck I can get tanks or Vents cheap… Karl Anthony Towns the basketball player has had massive deaths in his family and had covid himself… Do you think they are even aware they can just order Oxy tanks and vents online? I highly doubt it…. TSLA is valued at 1.1 trillion and makes about 2 billion \\\\[550x earnings\\\\] I have traded since a kid even at 100x they must make 11 billion… You do the math.HIMX was dead for months we traded it as low as 9.50…. They make cash. We used to trade TWI a lot! A LOT! A week ago the CEO indirectly said the company is worth 20… It shot from 6 to 8 and now its 10! These are money makers there is a reason the company has value. If I speculate there better be a reason. EZGO reports before January 31st if it wasn’t the bad Chinese sentiment I would be going crazy.

Now it is at 1.04. So that means that the stock was cheaper to buy as Europoor 1-2 years ago when the exchange was at 1.20 and now it go more expensive just because of the currency depreciation?\\n\\nThat basically means that my TSLA stock is keeping me safe from an € currency crash? Right? RIGHT?   \n",

July will be less due to the 14-day GF3 upgrade.

Trying to put the money in something as similar as possible for the 31 days instead of holding it as cash. Anyone else do this? XLK has the highest correlation to TSLA with .61 YTD. Was also thinking of doing ARKK since they have a high TSLA holding, but Cathie Woods and that fund have both been dogshit recently.   \n",

I personally think we may have a relief rally in July and resume the bear festivities through late summer and fall. We can't time the market, but most smart money is betting on big moves down in the next 12 months. TSLA &lt;$500 by November.   \n",

What if it's all fake, what if they hide all the shorts like gme, and the pump it, and then buy back on giant downfalls. And it's just all dark pool trades. Amd the richest man on the planet is just faked his way to the top, I mean tsla has barely ever made a profit as a company.   \n",

So I look at the options and do some calculations and reconfirm that there are so many other companies headed down with so much lower IV and so much more potential for reliable gains.  Then I remember that the TSLA cult and their cult leader have in the past and could easily in the future fuck the puts with more meme action. So, no thanks, once again I'll pass on this one.   \n",
